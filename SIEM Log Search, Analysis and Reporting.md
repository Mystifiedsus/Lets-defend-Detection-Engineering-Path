### Introduction to Log Search and Reporting

Security information and event management (SIEM) is an important technology that helps organizations protect complex security infrastructures and quickly detect security threats. SIEM collects, stores, analyzes and creates reports regarding security-related logs. This helps security teams protect their networks and systems while ensuring they meet compliance requirements.

  

## What is Log Search?

Log search is the process by which organizations query and analyze security events and event logs from different sources. Logs come from a variety of sources such as servers, network devices, security systems and applications. Log search aims to transform these logs into meaningful information by organizing, filtering and analyzing them. This helps detect potential security issues and threats.

  

## Log Analysis and Its Importance

Log analysis refers to the process of examining collected log data and extracting valuable information. Log analysis performs the following important functions:

  

  

**Identifying Abnormal Activity**

Logs help identify normal network and system activity. This makes it easier to detect abnormal activity.

  

  

**Threat Detection**

Log analysis is used to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. This strengthens the organization's defenses against threats such as malware, attacks or unauthorized access.

  

  

**Compliance Monitoring**

Many organizations must meet certain compliance requirements. Log analysis helps monitor these requirements and prepares for compliance audits.

  

## Reporting and Benefits

Log analysis results are presented in reports. Reports provide the following benefits to security teams and organizational managers:

  

  

**Security Status Monitoring** : Reports visually represent the organization's security status. This allows the security team to understand the security situation at a glance.

  

  

**Threat Scanning** : Reports help the organization examine detected threats and security incidents. This allows us to better understand and respond to security issues.

  

  

**Compliance Reports** : SIEM is used to monitor and report compliance requirements. Reports help the organization evaluate whether it is meeting the requirements.

  

In this part of the training, what log search is, the importance of log analysis, reporting and its benefits are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject of “ **Log Search** ” is explained.
