### Password Creation Principles

Password management is a critical issue for digital security. A strong and effective password management strategy is an essential step in ensuring the security of information, accounts, and systems. Password management includes users creating strong passwords, updating passwords regularly, and storing passwords securely.

The first step is to create strong passwords. Strong passwords should contain complex and hard-to-guess combinations. Its length, complexity, and uniqueness matter. Regularly changing passwords is a precaution that improves password security and helps protect accounts from malicious use.

Safe storage of passwords is also very important. Writing down passwords, leaving them around insecurely, and sharing them randomly poses a security risk. It is important to store and access passwords securely using password managers or encryption tools. These tools encrypt and protect passwords securely and provide the user with access to a single master password.

Password management also includes additional security measures such as two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication requires users to log in using a second authentication factor (for example, an SMS verification code, mobile app, or a physical security key). This ensures accounts are secured with an additional layer of protection.

  

## Password Creation Policies

Password creation policies should include the basic principles of creating strong and secure passwords. Password generation principles basically consist of important items such as length, complexity, uniqueness, unpredictability, regular password updates, using automatic password generation tools, etc.

  
  

**Length:** It is important that passwords are too long to guess easily. It is generally recommended to be at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords provide more robust protection.

**Complexity:** Passwords being complex will make them difficult to guess. It is ideal if it contains a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. For example, a complex password such as "P4sSW0rD54S3cUr!tY10" can be considered secure.

  
  

**Uniqueness:** It is important to use unique passwords for each account. Using the same password across multiple accounts will put all those accounts at risk if one account is compromised.

  

**Unpredictability:** Passwords should be unpredictable which will make it difficult for attackers to discover the password easily. Personal information such as birth dates, names, and phone numbers should be avoided.

  
  

**Automatic Password Generation Tools:** Automatic password generation tools can be used to generate secure passwords. These tools generate strong passwords randomly and provide an easy option for users.

Password generation policies guide the creation of strong and secure passwords. By following these principles, you can make passwords harder to guess, increase the security of accounts and data, and be more protected from malicious attacks.

Password Storage and Encryption
Password storage and encryption are important steps in keeping passwords secure and protecting them from malicious use. More information on Password Storage and Encryption is below:


Storing Password

Storing passwords in plain text poses a security risk. If passwords are compromised by unauthorized persons, they can easily access accounts and data. A secure method of storing passwords is to store passwords encrypted. In this method, the hash value of the password is calculated and this value is stored in the database so the password cannot be viewed in a clear text.


Password Encryption

Password encryption is another method for securely storing passwords. Encryption makes the password unintelligible, protecting it from unauthorized access. It is important to encrypt passwords using a strong encryption algorithm. Commonly used algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and bcrypt. It is important to securely store and manage the keys used for encryption. Protecting keys from unauthorized access ensures the security of the password encryption process.


Secure Password Storage Tools

Password managers or password storage tools can be used to securely store passwords. These tools encrypt and protect passwords and allow users to securely access passwords. Password managers are applications where users can securely store all their passwords with a single master password or key. In this way, users are encouraged to use complex and unique passwords. Password storage tools ensure that passwords are stored securely on the user's device. These tools create a database where passwords are stored encrypted and users can only access passwords with a master password or key.


Password storage and encryption are important steps that increase the security of passwords. Accounts and data can be compromised when passwords stored in plain text or weak encryption methods are used. Therefore, it is important to implement secure password storage and encryption methods.

For example, passwords on Linux are kept as in the image below.






In this part of the training, we have covered password storage and encryption. We will be learning about the “ Password Sharing and Communication ” topic in the next part of the training.

### Password Sharing and Communication

Password sharing and communication is an important issue for the secure sharing and transfer of passwords. If we fail to use the right methods, there is a high possibility for the passwords to fall into the hands of unauthorized persons. Here is some information on Password Sharing and Communication:

  

**Secure Sharing Methods**

When passwords need to be shared, secure methods should be used. Sending passwords via email, instant messaging, or plain text are totally risky. Instead, it is important to use secure encryption protocols. For example, tools such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) can be used to send passwords encrypted. It is also a preferred method to securely share passwords face-to-face or with people you trust. This reduces the risk of the password being compromised by unauthorized persons.

**Secure Communication Tools**

Secure communication tools should be preferred for the communication of passwords. It is important to use secure communication tools such as encrypted messaging apps or virtual private networks (VPN). In this way, the risk of passwords being compromised by unauthorized persons is minimized.

  

**Password Storage and Sharing Tools**

Password storage and sharing tools can be used to share passwords securely. These tools provide security by encryption methods when storing and sharing passwords. These tools facilitate the password-sharing process by enabling the secure sharing of passwords among users.

  

**Password Sharing Policies**

Organizations should set policies for password sharing. These policies should cover topics such as how passwords could be shared, with whom they could be shared, and which communication channels could be used to share them securely. Password-sharing policies increase security awareness and provide consistent security for password-sharing.

  

Password sharing and communication are important steps for securing passwords. Using the right methods and choosing secure communication tools makes the password-sharing process secure and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the important points to be considered about password sharing. The next part of the training will be about the “ **Password Theft and Threats** ” topic.

**Dictionary Attack**

A Dictionary Attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker tries to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network by using a pre-existing list of words, phrases, or passwords.

  
  

**Social Engineering**

Social engineering is the tactic of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving a victim in order to gain control over a computer system, or to steal personal and financial information. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

  

## Precautions Against Password Threats

  

- It is important to use strong and complex passwords. A complex password must be a combination of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.
- It is important to change passwords regularly. Changing passwords after a certain period of time reduces the risk of theft.
- Using multi-factor authentication increases security. Additional verification steps should be added, such as SMS verification, mobile app verification, or physical security keys.
- Using secure internet connections reduces the risk of passwords being stolen. Risky connections such as public networks or unsafe Wi-Fi hotspots should be avoided.
- Using reliable and up-to-date anti-virus software prevents password theft attacks leveraged through malicious software.

  

Keeping our credentials and personal information is a vital part of our information security and we should be very careful protecting them by taking security measures to ensure the security of our passwords. User awareness is important also, it is important for users to be wary of suspicious communications and fake websites.
