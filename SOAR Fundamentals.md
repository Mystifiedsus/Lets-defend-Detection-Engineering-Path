### Main Components of SOAR and Common Products

**Orchestration**

Orchestration ensures coordination between different security tools, systems, and processes to respond to security incidents. Without automation, many different steps must be performed manually to address a security incident. Orchestration provides speed and efficiency by automating these processes.

  

  

**Automation**

Automation involves automating security tasks that are repetitive or need to be performed on a regular basis. For example, when a threat is detected, the automation process can automatically perform tasks such as isolating the threat, analyzing it, or updating systems.

  

  

**Response**

SOAR provides the ability to respond quickly and effectively to security incidents. This may include actions such as resolving the incident, isolating it, cleaning malware, or recovering affected systems. Response processes are frequently automated based on established policies and procedures.

  

  

Ultimately, SOAR represents a combination of tools and processes designed to make security operations more effective and efficient. This approach is crucial to addressing the complexity of cybersecurity threats, reducing human errors and improving security with rapid responses. SOAR can be particularly useful for large-scale organizations and cybersecurity teams because it can help them deal with large amounts of security incidents and data.

  

The planning phase is very important for a SOAR that works correctly and efficiently.

  

## Common SOAR Products

There are many SOAR products on the market today, and while they all have their pros and cons, they all share the core goal of helping organizations automate and coordinate security operations.

### SOAR Planning and Sustainment

Planning for SOAR should be done taking into account the needs and objectives of the organization's security operations. The basic steps of the planning process are:

  

## Identifying Real Needs and Goals

It is necessary to determine the current status and future goals of the organization's security operations. This starts with understanding the organization's cybersecurity risks, existing security tools and processes, and the needs of security teams.

  

Determining the true needs and goals for SOAR begins with understanding the current state and future goals of the organization's security operations. This starts with understanding the organization's cybersecurity risks, existing security tools and processes, and the needs of security teams.

  

- Assess the organization's risks from cybersecurity threats. Doing this will help you understand which assets of the organization are at risk and what threats there are to those assets.

  

- Evaluate existing security tools and processes. Evaluate the organization's current security tools and processes. Doing this will help you understand how the organization's current security operations are working and what deficiencies exist.

  

- Assess the needs of security teams. Assess the needs of the organization's security teams. Doing this will help you understand what tasks security teams need help with and what tools and training they need.

  

  

After completing these steps, the real needs and goals of the organization will be determined. This information will help the organization develop a plan for the SOAR solution.

  

There are topics you should pay attention to when determining the real needs and goals for SOAR:

  

- Be realistic. Determine your organization's needs and goals, taking into account available resources and capabilities.

  

- Be measurable. Make your goals measurable so you can track your progress.

  

- Think long term. A SOAR solution should help improve your organization's cybersecurity operations in the long term.

  

- Identifying the real needs and goals for SOAR will help the organization get the most out of the SOAR solution.

  

  

## Evaluating the SOAR Solution

There are many large and small SOAR solutions on the market today. These products can include different features for workloads of different scales. Some of them can work only on Prem, some only on Cloud, and some on both On Prem and Cloud. Taking all these variables into consideration, a SOAR solution that meets the needs of the organization should be selected.

## Developing the Implementation Plan

A plan must be developed to implement the SOAR solution. This plan should describe how the solution will be installed, integrated, and used.

  

- Determine the steps required to implement the SOAR solution in the organization's production environment.
- Develop a plan to integrate the SOAR solution with existing security tools and processes.
- Develop a training plan so security teams can use the SOAR solution effectively.
- Develop a testing plan to verify that the SOAR solution is working smoothly.
- Develop a plan to manage and maintain the SOAR solution.

  

Doing some things wrong at the planning stage will have irreparable consequences in the future. Therefore, you should definitely consider the following issues when developing your implementation plan:

  

- The implementation plan should be a document that explains in detail how the solution will be implemented and used.
- The implementation plan should be prepared taking into account the organization's existing resources and capabilities.
- The implementation plan should be updateable in case requirements change.

  

## Application and Testing

The SOAR solution must be implemented and tested in the organization's production environment. This is necessary to verify that the solution works smoothly and meets the needs of the organization.

  

- Identify scenarios in which the SOAR solution will be tested. These scenarios need to represent the organization's actual security operations.
- Create a test environment to test the SOAR solution. This environment should be similar to the production environment. Create a test environment with the awareness that the need for a test environment for SOAR will never disappear. Remember, SOAR is a living structure and requires constant development, and these developments need testing.
- Implement the developed test cases and monitor the results.
- Analyze test results to determine where the solution needs improvement.

  

## Management and maintenance

The SOAR solution must also be managed once implemented. This ensures that the solution is kept up to date, protected against threats, and aligned with the needs of the organization.

  

In summary, here are some things to consider when planning for SOAR:

  

- The SOAR solution must be tailored to the specific needs of the organization. SOAR solutions have different features and capabilities. A solution that meets the needs of the organization must be selected.
- The SOAR solution must be compatible with the organization's existing security tools and processes. The SOAR solution must be able to integrate with existing security tools and be compatible with existing security processes.
- The SOAR solution should be used in conjunction with the training and support of the organization's security teams. Training and support must be provided for security teams to use the SOAR solution effectively.

  

Planning for SOAR helps increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's cybersecurity operations. Good planning ensures that the organization gets the most out of the SOAR solution.
