### Command Line Arguments

If you have an opinion on what Bash Scripting is, that's good news. In this course we will try to take our Bash Scripting knowledge one step further.

  

## Readings Arguments

On the Bash command line, arguments are the values given to the command line at the time a command or a Bash script is run. Bash enumerates these arguments like `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. and makes them accessible. Here is more information about bash command line arguments:

  

- `$0`: Represents the name of the command or script.

- `$1`, `$2`, `$3`,...: these are used to access the first second, third, etc. arguments on the command line.

- `$@`: Represents all command line arguments as an array.

- `$#`: Represents the total number of arguments given on the command line.

- `$*`: Represents all command line arguments as an array, but the arguments are concatenated into a single string.

- `$?`: Represents the exit status of the last command executed.

  

For example, we can print a message using command line arguments in the following script:

`#!/bin/bash  echo "Arguments from command line:" echo "Argument 1: $1" echo "Argument 2: $2" echo "Argument 3: $3" echo "All Arguments: $@" echo "Total Arguments Count: $#"`

To run this script, you can provide arguments on the command line like this:

`./arguments.sh Hello World!`
 
In this case, the script will access the arguments given on the command line and produce the following output:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash22.png)

  
  

In this example, `$1` gives us the first argument (`Hello`), `$2` the second argument (`World!`), and `$#` gives us the total number of arguments.

  

## shift

The shift command is used to shift command line arguments and change access. It is often used in conjunction with loops. Each shift command causes command line arguments to shift to the next position (dropping the previous argument). This allows us to access the arguments sequentially.

   `#!/bin/bash  echo "Arguments from command line:" echo "Argument 1: $1"  shift  echo "After shifting" echo "Argument 1: $1"`


  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash23.png)

  
  

In this example, we first print the first command line argument, $1. Next, we shift the arguments one position using the shift command. The shift command shifts all arguments one position to the left, and $1 now takes the previous $2 value. Therefore, in the second echo statement, the value $1 represents the second element of the command line arguments.

  

## Getopts

getopts is a structure used in bash script to parse command line arguments and catch certain flags or options. It is often used with a “while” loop. With getopts you can add certain flags or options to your script and have the user use those flags or options in a certain way.

 `#!/bin/bash  while getopts ":a:bc" opt; do   case ${opt} in     a)       echo "Option a is passed with value: $OPTARG"       ;;     b)       echo "Option b is passed"       ;;     c)       echo "Option c is passed"       ;;     \?)       echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG"       ;;   esac done`


As those of you who have worked in the Linux (or Unix) command line are familiar, we give some parameters to the command we will run on the Linux command line, and we do this by typing the parameter name (usually a letter) after the “-” sign. As you will notice, in this example we also had the opportunity to understand how this structure works.

  

In this example, we are checking three separate options using the -a, -b, and -c flags. The “getopts” loop captures each current flag as “$opt” and the value of the flag as “$OPTARG”. Then we act on certain flags with the case statement.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash24.png)

  
  

Finally, let's show that we can make the arguments alternative. In the example below, the user is allowed to use either "-o" or "--option" options.

This is a usage that provides comfort to the user when too many arguments are used.

`#!/bin/bash  while [[ "$#" -gt 0 ]]; do     case $1 in         -o|--option)             option_value="$2"             echo "Option value: $option_value"             shift 2             ;;         *)             echo "Invalid Argument: $1"             exit 1             ;;     esac     shift done`

### Shell Expansion - 1

Bash shell expansion is a property used to expand or evaluate special characters or expressions in a string. Expansion is performed immediately after a string on the command line, allowing the string to be replaced with a new value or otherwise manipulated.

  

Bash shell expansion supports the following special characters or expressions:

  

**Tilde expansion**

(~): The tilde character represents a user's home directory (`$HOME`). For example, we can combine `~` with `~/Documents` to represent the user's "Documents" directory.

  

  

**Parameter expansion**

($): The `$` character represents the value of a variable. For example, we can get the user's home directory using `$HOME`.

  

  

**Arithmetic expansion**

(()):  The expression `(( ))` is used to evaluate arithmetic expressions. For example, the expression `(( x = 5 + 3 ))` assigns the value 5 + 3 to the variable `x`.

  

  

**Conditional Expression Expansion**

The `(( ))` expression is used to evaluate conditional expressions. For example, with the expression `(( x > y ))` we can check whether the value `x` is greater than `y`.

  

  

**Brace Expansion**

(${ }): The `${ }` expression is used to retrieve or manipulate the values of variables or string expressions. For example, with `${var}` we can get the value of the variable `var`.

  

  

**Command Substitution**

(` ` or $( )): Command substitution is used to output a command and can be performed in two different ways by using backquotes (` `) or `$()`. For example, with the expression `result=$(date)` we can assign the output of the `date` command to the `result` variable.

  

  

**Arrays Expansion**

(${[ ]}): The `${[ ]}` expression is used to access the elements of arrays or perform operations related to the array. For example, we can access the first element of an array with the expression `${array[0]}`.

  

  

These special characters and expressions allow working with string manipulation, arithmetic operations, conditional expressions, values of parameters, and command outputs in the Bash shell. Bash shell expansion makes scripts more dynamic and flexible and allows us to do more powerful operations on the command line.

  

Now, review the following sample code and its output carefully, understand what is happening in each line and compare it with the output:

``#!/bin/bash  # Tilde Expansion (~) echo "Home Directory: $HOME" echo "Documents Directory: ~/Documents"  # Parameter Expansion ($) greeting="Hello, World!" echo "Greeting: $greeting"  # Arithmetic Expansion (()) (( x = 5 + 3 )) echo "x = $x"  # Conditional Expression Expansion (()) x=10 y=5 if (( x > y )); then   echo "x is greater than y" else   echo "x is not greater than y" fi  # Brace Expansion (${ }) name="John" echo "Hello, ${name}!"  # Command Substitution (` ` or $( )) current_date=$(date) echo "Current Date: $current_date"  # Array Expansion (${[ ]}) numbers=(10 20 30 40 50) echo "First Number: ${numbers[0]}"``

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash25.png)

  
  

Now, let’s review the expansion techniques in detail:

  

Expansions are used to modify the output of a particular command or code block. When bash receives a command that a user types on the keyboard or comes from a bash script, it splits it into words. In doing so, Bash can perform seven different operations on words, which can change how they are interpreted and thus the output. There are 7 different expansions that we can use in Bash. Now let's examine them one by one:

  

## Brace Expansion

Brace Expansion is often used to create variations of a particular pattern in Bash:

`touch file_{1..5}.txt`

This command creates five different files named file_1.txt, file_2.txt, file_3.txt, file_4.txt and file_5.txt.

  

Here, the expression {1.5} creates the numbers 1 to 5 using the brace expansion. The file_{1..5}.txt statement takes each of these numbers and converts them to filenames like file_1.txt, file_2.txt, ... file_5.txt.

  

Thus, we can create a series of files with a single command. This is very useful for generating file and directory names. Also, this can be useful if a command is run repeatedly with different parameters.

  

Let's do another example:

`#!/bin/bash for i in {1..3}; do     if [[ -r "file${i}.txt" ]]; then         echo "You have read permission for file${i}.txt"     else         echo "You do not have read permission for file${i}.txt"     fi done`

This script checks whether the files named "file1.txt", "file2.txt" and "file3.txt" are readable, if you have read permission for the files. The user is notified whether you have read permissions or not. When we run the script, a table is created as you can see below. There are 3 files named file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt in the directory and file2.txt belongs to the root user.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash35.png)

  
  

## Tilde Expansion

In the Bash shell, the tilde symbol usually points to a user's home directory. In Bash, the tilde (~) expansion is often used to easily access users' home directories. In other words, a tilde expansion is actually replacing a path that points to a user's home directory.

  

Here, before we move on to the examples, let's do a brief rundown of the basics of Linux:

On Linux systems, the user's home directories are located under the **/home** directory by default. But this is not an unchangeable rule; this can be changed when the user is added to the system or afterwards and this information is basically located in the **/etc/passwd** file.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash36.png)

  
  

As we mentioned above this is not an unchangeable rule and the sysadmin can relocate/move a user's directory to a different location.

  

Since we cannot know the home directories of all users in the system where the script will run, especially in cases where we will interact with the **home** directories of users while writing portable shell scripts, we leave this job to the tilde symbol and instead of taking risks by expressing the directory of a user whose name we know as /home/<username>/ we can express it as **~<username>** .

  

Let's give a few examples of different scenarios when using the tilde expansion:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/shell-table.png)

  
  

Now let's make an example and examine the results:

`#!/bin/bash echo ~ echo ~root echo ~/Documents echo ~root/Documents echo ~+ echo ~-`

### Shell Expansion - 2

## Parameter and Variable Expansion

In Bash, parameter and variable expansion are used to get the value of a variable. This variable can be a variable that we define in the script, or it can be a parameter that we give from the command line when calling our script. Parameter and variable expansion begins with the symbol `$` and continues with the name of the variable. For example, to create a variable named my_var and get its value, you can write code like this:

`#!/bin/bash my_var="Hello, World!" echo $my_var`

This piece of code will output the text, "Hello, World!".

  

Bash offers some features to adapt the extension to more complex use cases:

  

**Default Values:** If a variable is not defined, a default value can be assigned during expansion. We can use it as **${var:-default_value}.**
`#!/bin/bash echo ${name:-"Unknown"}`

In this example, if the variable **name** is not defined, it will output "Unknown".

  

**Error Checking:** If the **${var:?error_message}** form is used and if the variable is not defined, it will generate an error message and stop the script.

`#!/bin/bash echo ${name:?"Name is not set."}`

In this example, if the variable “ **name** ”is not defined, an error will be generated and the script will be stopped. It is important to understand the part that differs from the previous example. In the previous example, if the variable had no value, the script would continue by assigning a default value to it. In this example, the script will be stopped with the error message: “Name is not set.” and will not continue.

  

**Substring Replacement: ${var/find/replace}** usage replaces the “ **find** ” expression in the “ **var** ” variable with “ **replace** ”.  

`#!/bin/bash greeting="Hello, World!" echo ${greeting/World/Earth}` 

We start by assigning the "Hello, World!" value to the “ **greeting** ” variable. Then we replace the word " **World** " with " **Earth** " while the script is running. At the end, you will see the " **Hello, Earth!** " output after you run the script.

  

  

After the Variable expansion topic, let's do some practices of parameter expansion. Before moving on to the examples, let's remember that the concept of parameter is the inputs taken from the command line in bash scripting when running the script.

  

Adding parameters or arguments to a bash script is pretty straightforward. We can add parameters from the command line by leaving a space after the name of the script. These parameters are represented with $1, $2, $3, etc. that are special variables in the script. The first parameter is represented with $1, the second one will be with $2, and so on.

`#!/bin/bash echo "First Parameter: $1"`


If you run this script as ./myscript.sh Hello, you will get **First Parameter: Hello** .

  

So, what is the easiest way to know how many different parameters were sent to us while the script was running? If we do not know the number of arguments we receive and we want to control them all in the script, we can treat all parameters as an array. And, we can do it by using $@ or $* expression.
`#!/bin/bash  for prms in "$@" do   echo "Parameter: $prms" done`

 

Let's look at the sample output below:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash38.png)

  
  

## Command Substitution

Command substitution in Bash allows to use the output of one command as the input of another command. It is often used to assign the output of a command to a variable or use it as an argument to another command.

  

There are two ways to change commands. In fact, it would be more accurate to say that the same function has two different uses, old and new. We will describe both but suggest you use the second method.

  

**Grave Accents `...`** is the older method and often the newer method `$(...)` is preferred over this one due to its limitations in some cases.

  

**Dollar Sign and Parentheses `$(...)`** is the newer method and this method makes nested commands more readable and is generally preferred.

  

Although parentheses and quotes may seem confusing, they actually are not. Let's review them with examples:

  

We can assign the output of a command to the value of a variable:

`#!/bin/bash  now=$(date) echo "The current date and time is: $now"`
 
Every time you run this script, the “ **now** “ variable will be created with the current date and will produce a different output each time.

  

We can use the output of one command as an argument to another command.
`#!/bin/bash  echo "Directory contents: $(ls)"`

Notice that we do not define any variables and we output the ls command and use it at runtime.

  

And the most exciting part is that we can use them together:

`#!/bin/bash  echo "File sizes: $(du -h $(pwd))"`


In this example, we list the disk space used by the files in our current directory.

  

Being able to use the output of one command as the input of other commands can increase the complexity and functionality of your scripts. Let us remind you that you should be very careful about the error checks when using these features.

  

## Arithmetic Expansion

Arithmetic expansion in Bash allows you to evaluate arithmetic expressions and use its result. You can use the $((arithmetic_expression)) syntax for this. Bash treats this expression as an arithmetic expression and returns its result.

We can do this simply by enclosing arithmetic expressions in () and then using them in $():

`#!/bin/bash  echo $((5 + 2)) # Output: 7 echo $((5*2)) # Output: 10 echo $((10 / 2)) # Output: 5 echo $((10 - 5)) # Output: 5  num1=15 num2=5 echo $((num1 / num2)) # Output: 3`
  
## Word Splitting

Word splitting in Bash is the process of converting a string into multiple values by splitting it according to a certain separator. It is often used when looping over an array or when you want to split the output of a command into multiple values.

  

Let's start with a simple example:

`#!/bin/bash  my_string="LetsDefend is one of the best resources on cybersecurity"  for word in $my_string do   echo $word done`

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash39.png)

  
  

One important thing to note is how bash handles quotes. Word splitting does not occur when a string is in double quotes. In the example above, let's enclose the $my_string variable in the for line with “ “ and look at the output again:

`#!/bin/bash  my_string="LetsDefend is one of the best resources on cybersecurity"  for word in “$my_string” do   echo $word done`

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash-split.png)

  
  

In this case, `my_string` is treated as a whole single word, because double quotes prevent word splitting from occurring. That's why it's important to be careful when doing word splitting in bash. Depending on how the quotation marks are used, your results can vary significantly.

  

So, can we split a string only by spaces? No, we can customize it.

  

In Bash, Internal Field Separator (IFS) is a special variable used to determine how to split an array.

  

Using the IFS variable, you can split a string in bash by a specific character or string of characters. For example, you can set the IFS variable to a comma to split a comma-separated array:

 `#!/bin/bash  my_string="LetsDefend is ,one of the ,best resources on cybersecurity"  IFS=',' for word in $my_string do   echo $word done`

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash40.png)

  
  

One thing to note is that the IFS variable will be effective throughout your script. So, after changing the IFS variable for a loop or a custom operation, it's usually a good practice to return it to its original value:
`#!/bin/bash  my_string="LetsDefend is ,one of the ,best resources on cybersecurity"  old_IFS=$IFS IFS=',' for word in $my_string do   echo $word Done  IFS=$old_IFS`


By doing this we can prevent the IFS variable from accidentally causing unexpected behavior elsewhere. A good practice is to always keep the original value before using IFS so it can be restored later.

  

### Pathname Expansion

A feature called pathname expansion, or sometimes globbing, in Bash is the automatic mapping and expansion of file or directory names that fit a certain pattern. This is one of the bash shell expansion features and is usually done on the command line or in scripts.

  

Bash uses various special characters and structures for pathname expansion:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/shell-exp-t.png)

  
  
`#!/bin/bash  # It lists all txt files. ls *.txt  # Lists all files with a single character name. ls ?  # List all files with a, b or c in their name. ls *[abc]*  # Lists all files whose names match a given number range (1-3). ls *[1-3]*`


This feature allows you to work very flexibly when specifying file and directory names. It is especially useful when working with large amounts of files or when you quickly want to find files that match a particular name pattern. Pathname expansion is a core feature of many Unix-based operating systems and shells and is also supported in the bash shell.

  

Our example below,shows the **.log** files under the **/var/log/** directory and how many lines of data are in them.

  

`#!/bin/bash  dir_path="/var/log"  for file in $dir_path/*.log do   line_count=$(wc -l <"$file")   echo "$file file has $line_count line log" done`

Note that we use the wc (word count) command with the -l (only count lines) parameter to count the lines, assign the output of this command to the line_count variable, which we apply the variable expansion technique, and use this value in the next line.

### File and Directory Operations

## Creating Files and Directories

File and directory operations are an essential component of Bash programming, and learning about it is essential to develop and effectively use your Bash skills.

  

Mastering file and directory operations is critical to expand your Bash programming skills and creating more complex and effective scripts. It's important to read carefully, give examples, and practice while learning about this topic. Remember, in real-world scenarios, automating daily tasks and managing data using file and directory operations will be of great advantage.

  

  

It is important creating files and directories in bash scripting for organizing data, managing resources, and automating the workflow. Here are some methods of creating files and directories in Bash:

  

**Touch**

The `touch` command is used to update the timestamp of an existing file or to create a new file. For example, the `touch file.txt` command creates a file named `file.txt` or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

  

  

**echo ve redirection**

The `echo` command is used to write text or content to a file. For example, `echo "Hello, World!" > file.txt` command creates a file named `file.txt` and write "Hello, World!" text into it. You can use the `echo "New content" >> file.txt` command to append to an existing file.

  

  

**cat and redirection**

The `cat` command is used to create or edit the contents of a file. For example, you can use the `cat > file.txt` command to create a file and input content line by line. You can use the `Ctrl + D` key combination to complete the entry.

  

  

**printf ve redirection**

The `printf` command is used to generate formatted output. For example, the command `printf "Line 1\nLine 2" > file.txt` creates a file named `file.txt` and writes two lines of text in it.

  

  

**mkdir**

The `mkdir` command is used to create a directory with the specified name. For example, the `mkdir directory` command creates a directory named `directory`. You can also use `mkdir directory1 directory2 directory3` to create multiple directories.

  

  

**cp ve mv**

The `cp` command is used to copy files or directories. For example, the `cp source.txt target.txt` command copies the `source.txt` file with the name `target.txt`. The `mv` command is used to move or rename files or directories. For example, the `mv old.txt new.txt` command moves or renames the `old.txt` file to `new.txt`.

  

  

These methods are common methods of creating files and directories in Bash scripting. Using these processes, you can organize your data, automate your workflow, and manage it more effectively in your Bash scripts. By practicing creating files and directories, you can improve your Bash skills and successfully perform more complex tasks.

  

In the example script below, you can see the practical use of all of these together:

```

#!/bin/bash

# Create a file using 'touch' command
touch file.txt

# Write content to the file using 'echo' and redirection
echo "Hello, World!" > file.txt

# Append more content to the file using 'echo' and redirection
echo "This is a sample file." >> file.txt

# Create a file and enter content using 'cat' and redirection
cat > another-file.txt << EOF
This is another file.
It has multiple lines of content.
EOF

# Create a file using 'printf' and redirection
printf "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3" > third-file.txt

# Create directories using 'mkdir' command
mkdir directory1 directory2

# Copy files using 'cp' command
cp file.txt directory1/copied-file.txt
cp another-file.txt directory2/copied-file.txt

# Move files using 'mv' command
mv file.txt directory1/moved-file.txt
mv another-file.txt directory2/moved-file.txt

```



It is very important for you to better understand the subject by making each of these examples in your own environment and watching the results.

`#!/bin/bash  # Create a file using 'touch' command touch file.txt  # Write content to the file using 'echo' and redirection echo "Hello, World!" > file.txt  # Append more content to the file using 'echo' and redirection echo "This is a sample file." >> file.txt  # Create a file and enter content using 'cat' and redirection cat > another-file.txt << EOF This is another file. It has multiple lines of content. EOF  # Create a file using 'printf' and redirection printf "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3" > third-file.txt  # Create directories using 'mkdir' command mkdir directory1 directory2  # Copy files using 'cp' command cp file.txt directory1/copied-file.txt cp another-file.txt directory2/copied-file.txt  # Move files using 'mv' command mv file.txt directory1/moved-file.txt mv another-file.txt directory2/moved-file.txt`


It is very important for you to better understand the subject by making each of these examples in your own environment and watching the results.

  

## Reading Files

There are different methods for reading files from within the bash script. Let's take a look at the most important of them together:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash26.png)

  
  

**while loop and read:** The `while` loop and the `read` command are used to read file lines. For example:

`#!/bin/bash  # File to read file="file_for_read.txt"  while read -r line do     echo "Line: $line" done < "$file"`



  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash27.png)

  
  

In this example, the file `file_for_read.txt` is read line by line and each line is assigned to the variable `$line`. Then, each line is printed to the screen with the `echo "$line"` command.

  

**grep:** The `grep` command is used to search for a specific pattern in a file. For example, the command `grep "pattern to search" file_for_read.txt` searches for "pattern to search" in `file.txt` and prints the matching lines to the screen.

`#!/bin/bash  # File to search file="file_for_read.txt"  # Pattern to search for pattern="Another"  # Use grep to find the pattern in the file if grep -q "$pattern" "$file"; then     echo "Pattern found in the file." else     echo "Pattern not found in the file." fi`

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash28.png)

  
  

**awk:** The `awk` command is used to manipulate text files into rows, columns, and fields. For example, the `awk '{print $1}' file.txt` command prints the first field of each line in `file.txt`.

`#!/bin/bash  # File to read file="file_for_read.txt"  # Use awk to display the first word of each line awk '{print $1}' "$file"`


As you can see in the output below, we have listed the first columns in our sample file.

We should also mention that awk separates text from spaces, so if we used $3 instead of $1, we would see the 3rd word in each line.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash29.png)

  
  

**Reading fields with IFS and while loop:** If there is data separated by columns in the file, you can read the columns in the file by setting the Internal Field Separator (IFS) variable and using the `read` command. For example:

`#!/bin/bash  # File to read file="file_for_ıfs.csv"  # Read the file line by line while IFS= read -r line do     echo "Line: $line" done < "$file"`



  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash-file.png)

  
  

In this example, the columns are separated by commas in each row in the `file.csv` file. The `IFS` variable is set as a comma and the `read` command reads the columns individually and assigns them to the variables. Then the value of each column is printed to the screen.

  

These methods are the ones that are commonly used to read files within Bash script. It plays an important role in many scenarios such as reading data from files, text processing, data analysis and reporting.

  

## Moving Files

We can move files and directories with the "mv" command (short for move) in bash script.

  

Note that, in the example, the use of "mv" is the same as in the Linux console. Likewise, the use of Wildcard is also possible in the script. In the example code below, we have used possible use scenarios.

  

**Moving files without using a wildcard:** Here we move the files file1.txt and file2.txt to the destination/ directory.

  

**Moving files using wildcard:** Using the *.txt wildcard pattern, we select all .txt files in the current directory and move them to the destination/ directory

  

**Moving directories without using a wildcard:** We are moving directories directory1 and directory2 to the target/ directory.

  

**Moving directories using wildcard:** Using the dir* wildcard pattern, we select all directories starting with "dir" in the current directory and move them to the target/ directory.

  

This example shows you how to move files and directories in Bash script using the mv command. It includes both the use of wildcards and carry operations without a wildcard.

`#!/bin/bash  # Moving files without wildcard echo "Moving files without wildcard:" mv file1.txt file2.txt destination/  # Moving files with wildcard echo "Moving files with wildcard:" mv *.txt destination/  # Moving directories without wildcard echo "Moving directories without wildcard:" mv directory1 directory2 destination/  # Moving directories with wildcard echo "Moving directories with wildcard:" mv dir* destination/`

### RegEx and Bash

Bash scripts are powerful tools for performing text-based operations.

One of the capabilities of these scripts is the use of regular expressions (RegEx).

RegEx is a set of languages and techniques used to identify specific patterns in text and perform operations such as searching, matching and replacing according to these patterns.

In this course, we will explore the importance and different applications of using RegEx in Bash scripts.

  

With your bash scripts, you can produce fast and effective solutions for the following issues with Regex:

  

**Searching and matching text**

You can find and match texts with a certain pattern. For example, you can check if a particular word occurs in the text.

`#!/bin/bash  # Check if a string matches a pattern string="Hello, World!" pattern="^Hello"  if [[ $string =~ $pattern ]]; then     echo "Pattern matched!" else     echo "Pattern not matched!" fi`

**Editing text**

You can find and replace or delete specific patterns in the text. For example, removing parameters from a URL or removing spaces in text.
`#!/bin/bash  # Replace occurrences of a word in a string string="I love cats. Cats are amazing." pattern="cats" replacement="dogs"  new_string="${string//$pattern/$replacement}" echo "New string: $new_string"`

**Data validation**

You can use RegEx to check the accuracy of text-based data. For example, checking the validity of an email address or verifying the accuracy of a phone number.

`#!/bin/bash  # Function to validate email address using RegEx validateEmail() {     email=$1     pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"      if [[ $email =~ $pattern ]]; then         echo "Email address is valid."     else         echo "Email address is invalid."     fi }  # Prompt user to enter an email address echo "Enter an email address:" read user_email  # Call the validateEmail function with the entered email address validateEmail "$user_email"`

**Data analysis**

You can use RegEx to analyze text-based data and extract or report data based on certain patterns. For example, finding errors with a certain pattern in log files or extracting data in a certain format.

  

For example, let's have an "access.log" file of a web server like the one below:
`127.0.0.1 - - [28/May/2023:12:34:56 +0000] "GET /sayfa1 HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "https://www.example.com" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36" 127.0.0.1 - - [28/May/2023:12:34:57 +0000] "GET /sayfa2 HTTP/1.1" 200 5678 "https://www.example.com" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36" ...`

y

Let's say we want to see the "User Agent" strings in this file in bulk:

`#!/bin/bash  log_file="access.log"  # Check if log file exists if [ ! -f "$log_file" ]; then     echo "Log file $log_file not found."     exit 1 fi  # Function to extract user agents from log file extractUserAgents() {     while IFS= read -r line; do         user_agent=$(echo "$line" | awk -F'"' '{print $6}')         echo "User Agent: $user_agent"     done < "$log_file" }  # Call the extractUserAgents function extractUserAgents`

In this script, we define a function named "extractUserAgents". This function reads each line from the log file and uses a combination of awk and RegEx to extract the user agent from each line. The user agent is then printed to the console.

  

The script first checks if the log file exists. If the file is not found, an error message is displayed and the script gets terminated.

Let's finish with a more complex example of using regex in Bash Script.

Let's say we want to find e-mail addresses in a text file, check for validity and generate a report.

                    `#!/bin/bash  input_file="input_file.txt" output_file="report.txt"  # Check if input file exists if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then     echo "Input file $input_file not found."     exit 1 fi  # Function to validate email address validateEmail() {     email=$1     pattern="^([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,})$"      if [[ $email =~ $pattern ]]; then         echo "Valid Email: $email"     else         echo "Invalid Email: $email"     fi }  # Process input file and generate report processFile() {     while IFS= read -r line; do         # Find email addresses using regex         email_regex="[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"         emails=$(echo "$line" | grep -E -o "$email_regex")          # Validate and write emails to output file         for email in $emails; do             validateEmail "$email" >> "$output_file"         done     done < "$input_file"      echo "Report generated: $output_file" }  # Call the processFile function processFile`
             
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

As you will see, we are using a text file called inputfile.txt. The script will find the e-mail addresses in this file, check for validity and create a report file called report.txt.

  

The script first checks if the input file exists. If the file is not found, an error message is displayed and the script gets terminated.

  

A function named validateEmail is defined. This function uses a regex pattern to check if an email address is valid.

  

A function named processFile is defined. This function reads the input file line by line, finds email addresses using regex, validates each address, and writes the results to an output file called report.txt.

  

The script starts the process by calling the processFile function and performs the operations of finding email addresses, validating and generating reports.

  

This is an advanced scenario example that lets you find email addresses from a text file and report using regex. By running the script, you can process the text file and get the validity status of the e-mail addresses as a report:
