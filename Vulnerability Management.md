### Vulnerability Intelligence

Vulnerability Intelligence is a branch of intelligence that focuses on information about security vulnerabilities found in information systems, software, hardware or other technological products. This type of intelligence helps organizations and individuals understand and take precautions against cybersecurity risks.

VI is indispensable for institutions to be prepared and cautious against cyber attacks.

A correctly constructed VI structure provides effective risk management by identifying risks in advance.

In addition, having fast and accurate information about security vulnerabilities enables both to identify risks related to the inventory within the institution and to respond quickly to incidents that require incident response.

Knowing which vulnerabilities take priority allows resources to be used more effectively.

  

## Detection of Security Vulnerabilities

Information about security vulnerabilities is collected from different sources (CVE databases, security researchers, manufacturers, etc.). While there are open sources where this type of data can be collected, there are also many commercial services that classify the data collected from different sources and make it easier for you to use.

  

## Risk assessment

The collected vulnerability information is analyzed and evaluated to evaluate how critical they are to an organization or system.

  

## Tracking Updates and Patches

Patches and updates released from manufacturers or third-party sources are monitored for security vulnerabilities found.

Vulnerability Intelligence helps take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. In other words, it contributes to the development of a preventive and prepared attitude, rather than a reactive one, in the face of potential threats. In this way, it may be possible to prevent cyber attacks or data breaches before they occur or minimize their impact.

  

## VI Resources

Vulnerability Intelligence (VI) goes beyond cybersecurity solutions and includes processes such as detecting and evaluating security vulnerabilities and coordinating responses to these vulnerabilities. The purpose of VI is to enable organizations to understand and mitigate risks to their IT infrastructure.

  

In this part of the training, what vulnerability intelligence is and some issues about vulnerability intelligence are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject of " **Cyber Security Intelligence** " is explained.

### Cyber Security Intelligence

Cyber security intelligence is a very broad field that covers all kinds of information, documents and events regarding cyber security.

Today, cyber attacks are carried out by groups of threat actors as well as individual attackers. The world of cyber security has become a huge world where there are cyber security experts, users of cyber security products and information systems on one side, and cyber criminals on the other side, and both sides are in constant change and development.

In such a fast-moving world, unfortunately, just using up-to-date operating systems, up-to-date network devices, and up-to-date security products is not enough to stay safe; on the contrary, it is a necessity at the beginner level. Another imperative is to follow what is happening in this world very closely and in as real time as possible. Because you may be the next target of a threat actor targeting an institution on the other side of the world. Therefore, it is very important to be informed about these events as early as possible, access their details, and check as soon as possible whether similar risks apply to you.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti3.png)

  
  

Let's try to understand it with some more concrete examples:

By looking in the logs of our own security devices for the IP address that a threat actor used to attack a different company, we can determine whether the same actor is targeting us.

If we know the applications/services that actors use as entry points in their successful attacks targeting different institutions, we can check whether we use these applications/services and, if so, take precautions before an incident occurs.

If we can access the payload information that actors use to attack a web service, IDS, IPS, WAF, etc. We can take precautions by positioning the rules regarding the relevant payload in our products.

If we have the hash information of an executable file or a webshell that the actors use during the attack, we can prevent the attacker from targeting us by defining this hash information in our endpoint security product.

When it comes to Cyber Security intelligence, every piece of data/information will be important. Intelligence does not always have to be about harmful activities. For example, let's say your organization has a mobile application and this mobile application runs on your customers' mobile phones. Under normal circumstances, we would expect this application to be accessed only from end user IP addresses, in other words, it is at least suspicious that the IP address reaching this application is an IP address belonging to a data center. Because the person trying to access your application using this IP address may be a legal user using a VPN service hosted in the relevant data center, or it may be an attacker trying to access your mobile application and scan for vulnerabilities through a server he has captured or rented in the data center. In this case, even if this IP address is clean for reputation services, it is suspicious for us. If we have an intelligence source that provides residential or datacenter IP address information, we can also develop rules/measures on this issue.

Another issue is “what leaks from us”. Attackers do not always harm us by using vulnerabilities in our web services/applications and zer0-days in the systems we use. For example, a notebook that one of our users drops while walking on the street, with his e-mail address and password written on it, is also a risk and a matter of intelligence for us. Because the user will probably not tell us “I lost my notebook with my passwords in it”. However, this type of data can be shared and sold by attackers in underground forums and darkweb markets. Therefore, it is important for us to stay aware of what is happening here to stay safe.

As we understand from the examples, the more we expand our coverage of cyber security intelligence, the safer we are.

For Vulnerability Management, which is the subject of our course, we first need to know what the current "Vulnerability"s are and this information is a part of cyber security intelligence.

Now let's take a look at how we can access this intelligence:

  

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Collecting information from publicly available sources, forums, blogs, news sites and official vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD) is called Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Although there are many OSINT resources on the Internet, the two most important resources that list vulnerabilities for Vulnerability Management, which is the subject of our course, are CVE and NVD.

  

**CVE**

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a vulnerability identification and classification system. CVE.org is the official website related to this system and is managed by MITER Corporation. This platform provides information security professionals, system administrators, and software developers with a framework to identify, classify, and share vulnerabilities.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti12.png)

  
  

When security researchers, software companies, or other parties discover a vulnerability, they report this information to the CVE. The CVE reviewing this notification creates a unique CVE ID for each vulnerability. In the next step, information such as details of CVE vulnerabilities, the systems it affects, possible effects and solution suggestions are collected and this information is published in the CVE database and made available for public access. CVE records are updated as new information about the vulnerability comes in or the status of the vulnerabilities changes.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti13.png)

  
  

All this information is integrated with security products and made available to security professionals, thanks to the infrastructure support provided by CVE.

  

### **NVD**

NVD is a vulnerability database managed by the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NVD is based on the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) system and provides more details, metrics and analysis about these vulnerabilities.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti14.png)

  
  

NVD uses the CVE database as a source, but classifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities according to various criteria.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/v1.png)

  
  
  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/v2.png)

  
  

CVSS uses three main sets of metrics when scoring vulnerabilities:

  

**Base Metrics:** These metrics evaluate the key characteristics of a vulnerability.

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Specifies the method by which the attack will be made (e.g. network, local, etc.).
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Indicates how complex the attack is.
- **Privileges Required (PR):** Shows what privileges are needed for the attack.
- **Impact Metrics:** These metrics evaluate the impacts of the vulnerability (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

  

**Temporal Metrics:** These metrics evaluate factors that may change over time:

- **Exploitability (E):** The possibility of exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Remediation Level (RL):** The status of the current solution.
- **Report Confidence (RC):** Accuracy of information about the vulnerability.

  

**Environmental Metrics:** These metrics evaluate how impactful the vulnerability will be in a particular environment:

- **Collateral Damage Potential (CDP)**
- **Target Distribution (TD)**
- **Modified Base Metrics:** Basic metrics change according to environmental factors.

  

Using these metrics, a CVSS score between 0 and 10 is calculated for each vulnerability. The higher the score, the more critical the vulnerability is considered.

**0.0 - 3.9** : Low

**4.0 - 6.9** : Medium

**7.0 - 8.9** : High

**9.0 - 10.0** : Critical

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti15.png)

  
  

The CVSS score is a user scoring system designed to help organizations assess risk, prioritize and take appropriate security measures.

  

## Special Resources

Apart from open sources, there are also commercial security products that search for security vulnerabilities, classify them and publish them to their customers. These services generally work by constantly scanning the vulnerabilities in the existing software and hardware inventories of the customers they serve and generating reports/alarms in case of any risk. They contribute to creating a safe environment by automating and periodic these scans.

  

### **Tenable.io**

As examples of these services, we can give the cloud-based service offered by Tenable Security and available at tenable.io:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/v3.png)

  
  

This service scans your assets at intervals you specify and produces a report of your current security status. For example, if the version of a web server you run within your organization is a vulnerable version, it will report this to you.

Teenable.io offers advanced methods for monitoring your existing assets both inside and outside the organization, using sensors to scan your systems that cannot be accessed from outside the organization when necessary. In the screenshot below, we see an example of assets extracted as a result of automated scans:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti16.png)

  
  

We can also view details about each of these assets:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/v4.png)

  
  

### **Acunetix**

We can give Acunetix as another example of these services.

  

Acunetix is an automatic scanning tool used to evaluate the security of web applications. It is specifically designed to detect, analyze and report security vulnerabilities in web applications. Acunetix can detect many different types of web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti17.png)

  
  

Acunetix offers both automatic scanning options and tools for manual scanning. It analyzes detected vulnerabilities in detail and determines risk levels. Can create detailed security reports using the findings. These reports may also include recommendations on how to resolve vulnerabilities. It can easily integrate with other security tools and processes.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/2/cti18.png)

  
  

### **Others**

There are dozens of services of different scales and scopes, such as these services we have given as examples. As you will have noticed in the screenshots above, both services actually use the CVE database and NVD scoring, but they provide us with traceability and visibility by automating a lot of the work for us. In this case, you can use one of these products that suits your business and needs, or you can write your asset scanners using the methods explained in scripting lessons, extract data from open databases, and develop simple security tools by matching these data with each other.

  

## Feeds and APIs

It is possible to obtain real-time vulnerability information through automatically updated, commercial or free feeds and APIs. For example, you can add new information added to CVE or NVD to your own security products with the help of feeds or APIs.

You can access CVE's feeds from the following link: [https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#pc_cve_list_basicscve_list_data_feeds](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#pc_cve_list_basicscve_list_data_feeds)  

  

  

## Domestic Intelligence Collection

Analysis of data from monitoring and scanning tools within the organization (e.g. IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning tools) will also provide you with important data.

For example, an alarm occurring on an IDS product may lead you to a malicious application on a user's computer. Let's proceed with an example:

As you know, IDS products generally work with signature databases and look for contents that match those in the signature databases in the packets in the traffic provided to them. The “cleartext password” alarm you receive from your IDS product may actually be the only malicious activity caught in the IDS signature of a malware that has started to spread inside. When you investigate the source of the activity that creates this alarm, you can access the PUA on a user's computer, the hash of this PUA, etc. You can stop malicious software before it spreads by searching for its information on your other systems.

  

## Security Researchers and White Hat Hackers

Independent security researchers sometimes report security vulnerabilities they find to organizations. Additionally, such information can be accessed through bug bounty programs. Security researchers who do this job professionally regularly publish their findings on their social media accounts and/or personal blogs.

  

## Zer0-Day Intelligence

Using private intelligence sources is a very useful and common method to detect security vulnerabilities that are not yet known by the manufacturer or the community and have not been patched. In this way, you can detect vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers in the software you use within your organization, before the software manufacturer notifies you, and take precautions.

  

## Last Word

Vulnerability Intelligence is not just about detecting vulnerabilities. Evaluating what these detected vulnerabilities mean for the organization, prioritizing these vulnerabilities, and coordinating the remediation processes of vulnerabilities are also critical components of VI.

  

In this part of the training, the sources that feed the field of cyber security intelligence and some issues related to cyber security intelligence are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject “ **Deep Dive to Vulnerability Scanners** ” is explained.

## What is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a weakness or deficiency in a computer system, network, application or other digital resource. This vulnerability allows malicious actors or software to gain unauthorized access to the system, steal data, misuse system resources, or perform other harmful actions.

Security vulnerabilities can often arise for many different reasons, such as software bugs, configuration errors, weak password policies or user errors. For example, if software is not updated, it may be exposed to a known security vulnerability. Likewise, if a user uses a weak password, it can also create a security vulnerability.

Another reason why vulnerabilities are dangerous is that they can often exist for a long time undetected. This makes it easier for attackers to infiltrate the system and carry out their malicious actions. Therefore, identifying security vulnerabilities and keeping systems safe by closing these vulnerabilities is of critical importance in the world of cybersecurity.

Many different tools and methodologies are available to manage vulnerabilities. These include vulnerability scanning tools, patch management, risk assessment and security policies. However, in order to effectively manage vulnerabilities, these tools and methodologies need to be considered as a whole and constantly updated.

  

## What is Vulnerability Scanning?

Vulnerability scanning is a process used to detect vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, or application in an automatic or semi-automatic manner. These scans are usually performed using special software tools. The aim is to identify potential security vulnerabilities and prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited by malicious people.

Vulnerability scans are typically performed in three different categories:

  

**Static Scan**

This type of scanning is performed by analyzing the application's code. It is done before the application is run and tries to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.

  

**Dynamic Scanning**

This type of scanning is performed in an environment where the application is running. The goal is to see how the running application reacts and identify possible vulnerabilities.

  

**Interactive (Hybrid) Scanning**  

This type of scanning is a combination of static and dynamic scanning. Both code analysis is performed and the application is tested by running it.

Vulnerability scans are usually performed in accordance with a specific policy or template. These policies determine what types of vulnerabilities to look for, how deep to scan, and how to report scan results.

Scan results are usually presented in a report. This report explains in detail the detected security vulnerabilities, what kind of risks these vulnerabilities pose and how these vulnerabilities can be remedied.

As a result, vulnerability scanning is a critical part of a cybersecurity strategy. These scans enable organizations to constantly monitor their security posture and act proactively against potential threats.

  

In this part of the training, what a security vulnerability is, what the vulnerability scanning process is, and briefly vulnerability scanners are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the topic “ **Tenable.io** ” is explained.

### Tenable.io

Tenable.io is a very popular and effective vulnerability management platform in the cybersecurity industry. This platform, which has a cloud-based structure, allows organizations to detect, analyze, and manage security vulnerabilities. Although Tenable.io is generally preferred by medium and large-sized businesses, it also offers suitable solutions for small businesses. Let's take a quick look at its features first:

  

**Comprehensive Scanning Options:** Tenable.io can perform detailed vulnerability scans on networks, applications, devices, and even cloud services.

**Flexibility and Scalability:** Thanks to its cloud-based structure, you can scale Tenable.io according to your needs and manage it from different locations.

## Interface

First, let's examine what's in Tenable.io's interface and make sure we don't lose our way in the following sections:

  

**Dashboard**

The main screen of the Dashboard includes scan results, risk scores, and a summary of open vulnerabilities. This way, you can get a quick idea of your security situation.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti36.png)

  
  

**Scans**

We can use this section to start a new vulnerability scan, view existing scans, or create scan templates.

When we go to the Scans menu, we are greeted with a screen like the one below. On this screen, we can see details such as how the current scan processes work, the last run time, and whether the last run was completed without any problems.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti26.png)

  
  

We can immediately start a new scan with the buttons in the upper right corner of the screen.

  

**Create** **scan**

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti22.png)

  
  

**Basic Network Scan,** we are presented with the following screen:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti25.png)

  
  

On this screen:

  

In Field #1, we give our scan a name.

In Field #2 we add a description for our scan.

We choose which Scanner we will use in field No. 3. Two options will be waiting for us here: **Internal Scanner** and **Cloud Scanner** .

In field No. 4, we make the settings for the scanner type we selected in field No. 3.

We determine the target of the scan in field No. 5 and click on the “Save&Launch” button in the lower right corner of the page.

  

**Scanner** **types**

Internal Scanner is the scanner we generally use to scan assets/targets within the organization. In other words, it is useful for scanning networks that cannot be accessed over the internet under normal conditions in our organization.

Cloud Scanner, on the other hand, is the scanner we will use to scan our targets from a point outside our corporate network.

Let's explain their differences with an example:

Let's look at the diagram below. Our company has a network. In this network, we have servers broadcasting to the internet in the DMZ area. In the server network, we have servers that serve only users within the company. As a result of the scanning we started with Tenable Cloud Scanner, the first device that will receive the scanning traffic will be the “COMPANY FW” device. Naturally, this device will only allow requests going towards the web and mail servers to enter and direct these traffics to the “DMZ FW” device. If our traffic can get permission from “DMZ FW”, it will reach our WEB or MAIL server. Again, due to the permissions on the route, the scanner will only be able to talk to port 443 of our web server, for example. In this case, the scanner will report to us that we have a web server running on port 443 (maybe the version of the server, etc.), but it will not be able to report any more details. This scenario is great just to get a sense of what looks like from the outside. So is it enough? For example, if a service that should not be running on the Web Server is running on port 80, we will not be able to see it.

That's why we need internal scanners positioned in the right places. In the image below, with an internal scanner connected to the “DMZ SW” switch and adjusted correctly, we will be able to report everything that is happening in the “DMZ NETWORK”.

However, we probably will not even be aware of the existence of the "FILE SRV" machine when viewed from within the "DMZ NETWORK". Therefore, we are still unaware of our status in the “SERVERS” network. However, for an attacker who manages to reach the OFFICE network or an internal threat actor who is already there, this area is accessible and therefore an important attack surface for us. That's why we'll need to position an internal scanner there and monitor what's going on there.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti27.png)

  
  

By the way, let's talk about the differences between **Nessus Scanner** and **Nessus Sensor** .

These two concepts basically serve the same purpose.

Nessus Scanner is used on smaller network segments and operates standalone.

Nessus Sensor collects and manages data from scanners by being positioned in complex networks.

  

**Scan** **templates**

Nessus scan templates in Tenable.io are templates that contain preconfigured settings and parameters for specific scan operations. These templates are designed to meet different security requirements and can be customized by users. Below are some examples explaining the basic functionality of Nessus raster templates:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti28.png)

  
  

**Quick Scan:** The quick scan template is designed to quickly detect key vulnerabilities in your network. This template requires fewer resources and time than more comprehensive scans .

  

**Full Scan:** The full scan template performs a more comprehensive scan to find all vulnerabilities on your network. This may require more resources and time, but provides more detailed results.

  

**Patch Management Scan:** This template is designed to detect and manage missing security patches on your systems. Missing security patches can be exploitable by malicious attackers.

  

**Penetration Testing Scan:** This template is used to actively exploit vulnerabilities in your network and simulate real-world penetration tests. This scan can help you better understand potential threats on your network.

  

**Mobile Device Scan:** Used to evaluate the security status of your mobile devices. Detects vulnerabilities between mobile applications and devices.

  

Nessus scan templates in Tenable.io are used to detect vulnerabilities and reduce risks in your network. Depending on the need and requirements, these templates can be customized or new templates can be created. These scanning patterns can help your security team identify and fix vulnerabilities in your network.

  

  

**Findings**

Tenable.io Findings refer to potential security issues and threats that the Tenable.io security platform detects during security scans. These detections are the results obtained as a result of security scans performed to identify vulnerabilities, weak points and risks on the systems, applications and devices in your network.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti29.png)

  
  

Tenable.io scans your network using various security scanners and tools and presents the results in reports called Findings. These detections may include various security issues such as:

  

**Weak Passwords:** During scans, Tenable.io may detect accounts that can be accessed using weak or guessable passwords.

  

**Open Ports and Services:** Scanning detects open network ports and services running on those ports. This may lead to unauthorized access or infiltration attempts.

  

**Missing Security Patches:** Tenable.io can identify systems and applications where security patches are missing. This can increase the chances of malicious actors infiltrating your system due to unupdated software.

  

**Weak Configurations:** Misconfigured settings or security policies can be detected during security scans and create potential risks that need to be fixed.

  

**Malware Signals:** Tenable.io may detect malware signatures or traces of malware activity during scanning.

  

**Authentication Errors:** Errors or vulnerabilities in authentication processes can allow malicious individuals to gain unauthorized access. Tenable.io constantly scans and reports your network and assets for such vulnerabilities, allowing you to detect potential problems before attackers and provide solutions.

  

Findings provides you with critical information to understand and resolve potential threats and risks on your network.

  

**Assets**

Tenable.io Assets is a term used in the Tenable.io security platform and represents assets that reside on your organization's network and are critical to security. These assets may include devices, servers, applications, network segments, and other digital resources on your network. Tenable.io Assets is used to monitor, manage, and evaluate these assets during security scans.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti30.png)

  
  

Let's take a look at what we can do using the Tenable.io Assets feature:

  

**Asset Tracking:** Tenable.io automatically detects and catalogs all assets on your network. This helps you create and keep your organization's asset inventory up to date.

  

**Asset Classification):** Tenable.io Assets can classify assets according to their importance. For example, you can isolate servers that host critical systems and sensitive data.

  

**Asset Attributes:** Various attributes can be defined for each asset. This provides more information about the assets' functionality, owner, location, and other characteristics.

  

**Vulnerability Tracking:** Tenable.io Assets can track assets for vulnerabilities or missing security patches. This helps you monitor your organization's security posture.

  

**Malware Tracking:** Tenable.io Assets can be used to track assets to detect malware or malicious activities and detect such threats.

  

**Risk Assessment:** Tenable.io Assets helps you assess and prioritize the security risks of assets. It can help you determine whether important assets have risks that require further attention.

  

Tenable.io Assets helps you better understand, classify, monitor and protect the assets in your network. This feature is important for detecting vulnerabilities, managing risks and meeting compliance requirements. What is important to remember is that effective monitoring and management of assets provides a stronger defense in cybersecurity for organizations.

  

**Reports**

Tenable.io offers a great reporting interface. Thanks to this interface, you can get almost any output you need, completely customized to your own needs. Built-in templates are often sufficient:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti31.png)

  
  

However, in cases where it is not sufficient, you can create reports by drag and drop method with the report creation tool and run and update them whenever you want. 

  

**Settings**

You can make general settings, user management and integrations of the Tenable.io platform through this section.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti32.png)

  
  

There are many options under this menu, let's take a look at some of the frequently used ones:

The settings menu found in Tenable.io's interface is used to configure and customize different components of the platform. Below is a list explaining the main functions under Tenable.io's general settings menu :

  

**General:** Under this menu, you can manage settings such as Severity Metrics (CVSSv2, CVSSv3), SLA Values, Application language options, Default export retention periods, Plugin Output Search options to be used in the scan results.

  

**My Account:** Under this heading, you can edit options such as Username, Email, Password for your account and make 2FA settings.

  

**SAML:** You can configure Single Sign On settings under this menu. In this way, you will have a more manageable environment by allowing your users to log in to the application from a central location.

  

**License:** Under this menu, you can see the status of your current licenses. Information such as which modules you have licenses for, how many days of these licenses remain, and how many of these licenses you use are under this menu.

  

**Access Control:** Under this menu, you can create users, roles and groups and assign permissions to these users, roles and groups. You can also see details such as the status of your current users, their last login time, and the number of incorrect logins under this menu.

  

**Activity Logs:** Under this menu, you can monitor and report in detail all the activities of your users, automations and integrations on the platform.

  

**Dashboards:** Under this menu, you can view and edit existing dashboards and create new dashboards for your needs with click, drag and drop logic. While doing this, you can use and customize the templates available in tenable.io, or you can create solutions from scratch and add ready-made widgets.

  

**Sensors:** Under this menu, you can see the existing cloud scanners and the internal scanners you have installed in your own environment and monitor their online/offline status.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/4/cti33.png)

  
  

You can manage all the building blocks in the Scanner->Sensor->Tenable.io chain under this page and monitor their status.

  

**Credentials:** Under this menu, you can define the credentials to be used in scans. As you know, some vulnerabilities (privilege escalation, etc.) require access first. We can enable Nessus to perform more comprehensive scans by giving Nessus accounts at various authority levels to the systems. For example, in a situation where we do not provide Credentials, Nessus can only scan ports etc. on a Linux machine. Once we provide it with credentials, it will be able to log in to the system and perform more detailed scans.

  

**Exclusions:** In some cases, we may want some of our assets to be excluded from the scanning scope. In these cases, we can make these settings from this menu.

  

**Cloud Connectors:** Cloud and virtualization technologies are now an indispensable part of computing infrastructures. On the other hand, it is not possible to perform vulnerability scanning of services built with these technologies using conventional methods.

  

For this reason, tenable.io offers some solutions specific to cloud, container and virtualization technologies. We use the Cloud Connector menu to define these types of services on the tenable.io platform and scan for vulnerabilities.

## Last word

Tenable.io is a very advanced tool that, when used correctly, allows you to view and manage all your risks regarding all your assets together. The most important detail that should not be overlooked is that knowing our vulnerabilities and weak points alone will not keep us safe. The main thing is to eliminate them as quickly as possible with the right approach and planning.

  

In this part of the training, the tenable.io vulnerability management platform is mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject “ **Deep Dive to Web Application Security Scanners** ” is explained.

### Deep Dive to Web Application Security Scanners

## What is Web Application Security?

Web Application Security is a discipline that includes security measures and practices taken to ensure that web applications and websites are protected against various cyber threats and attacks. It includes a set of techniques, procedures, and best practices aimed at improving the security of web applications and websites.

Web applications are software or services that are accessed and used by users and can be exposed to many different security threats. These threats include various types of attacks such as data leakage, identity theft, SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Web Application Security includes the following key steps to protect against such threats:

  

**Authentication and Authorization:** Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms are used to authenticate users and allow access only to authorized users.

  

**Data Entry Audit:** When users log in to web applications or submit data, data entry audits are performed to ensure that that data is secure and accurate.

  

**Database Security:** Databases are critical components where web applications store sensitive data. Therefore, access to and security of databases is of particular importance.

  

**Attack Detection and Prevention:** Security tools such as firewalls and penetration tests are used to detect and prevent attacks.

  

**Update and Patch Management:** It is important to keep web applications and infrastructures updated and to apply security patches regularly.

  

**Code Review and Security Tests:** The codes of web applications are regularly examined for security vulnerabilities and security tests are performed.

  

**Training and Awareness:** Users and developers are made more aware through security awareness and training.

  

Even though we operate or try to operate these steps correctly, there may be details that are overlooked from time to time, and these overlooked details return to us as losses of reputation, money and time that are very difficult to compensate. Therefore, it is very important to check the effectiveness of some or all of our measures on the issues listed above and to make sure that everything is working correctly.

  

## What is Web Application Security Scanner?

Web Application Security Scanner is a software or service used to automatically detect vulnerabilities and weaknesses in web applications. These browsers are used to increase the defense of web applications and sites against cyber threats and prevent potential attacks. There are many products on the market, some commercial and some open source. Let's first take a look at the working methods and outputs of Web Application Security Scanners in general terms:

  

**Specify Crawl Target:** The first step is to determine the URLs or IP addresses of the web applications or sites to crawl. The scanner will work towards this goal.

  

**HTTP Requests and Responses:** The browser sends HTTP requests to the target web application and receives responses. These requests interact with the web application and do some discovery in the process. Generally, at this stage, endpoints in the target system, details of the responding web server, allowed methods, fields used in the form in the target system, etc. Details such as are collected.

  

**Weakness Analysis:** Using the data obtained in the previous article, the browser analyzes different components of the web application (forms, URLs, database queries, etc.) and looks for potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It usually involves detecting common types of attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

  

**Penetration Attempts:** The browser pretends to attack the web application by using the exploit methods it knows about the weaknesses it detects and uses various attack vectors (payloads) to detect vulnerabilities. This verifies the existence of vulnerabilities by observing how the application's response changes.

  

**Reporting:** The scanner presents detected vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a detailed report. The reports are reviewed by the organization's security team or developers and vulnerabilities that need to be fixed are identified.

  

Theoretically, we can do everything Web Application Security Scanners do. But this is a job that will require a lot of time and effort for us. It will also require a huge amount of labor when we have a large number of target systems.

Web Application Security Scanners are a great way to automate things. Once we give the targets and specify what type of scans to do and how often, we can only deal with the reports.

In most scenarios, they are very useful and useful tools that prevent many possible risks in the first place by analyzing not only actively used systems but also systems that have not yet been published.

As we said above, there are many products and services on the market today for this purpose, and they all have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. Therefore, when you need such a product, the best approach would be to first make a list of your needs and then filter the products according to this list of your needs.

Since we do not have the chance to explain all the products here, we will continue from here on by telling about Acunetix.

  

In this part of the training, what web application security is and web application scanners are briefly mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject of “ **Acunetix** ” is explained.

---

### Acunetix

Acunetix is a popular web application security scanner and automation tool used to assess web application security and detect vulnerabilities. It helps determine how secure web applications are against cyber threats and attacks.

Thanks to its advanced structure, it scans your web applications periodically and automatically, reports vulnerabilities, integrates with your other security and reporting products, and ensures that you are aware of the problems related to your web applications, which are one of the most important attack surfaces.

  

## Overview

When we log in to Acunetix, we are greeted by a very simple dashboard interface. In this dashboard, we can view summary information about the targets we have previously defined to Acunetix and quickly obtain information about our current security situation. We can access this dashboard anywhere in the application by clicking “overview” from the menu on the left.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti37.png)

  
  
  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti38.png)

  
  

## Discovery

One of the departments we will use most within Acunetix is Discovery.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti39.png)

  
  

In this section, you will see the list of targets you have previously defined and the "First Seen" and "Last Seen" values for these targets. This information is important to make sure everything goes well.

In the submenus under the same section, you can see the "Inclusions" and "Exclusions" settings.

Acunetix's "Discovery" section is used for the preparation and configuration operations you need to do before scanning web applications. This section allows you to configure important settings and define targets before starting the scan. When Discovery first opens, you'll see a breakdown of the targets you've previously entered.

  

**Add Destination URLs** : Add the URLs or IP addresses of the web applications or sites you want to crawl. This helps you determine the targets that Acunetix will scan.

  

**Add Authentication Information** : If web applications require login, add authentication information (username and password). This allows the browser to log in and detect vulnerabilities while logged in.

  

**Adding Session Management Information** : If session management is required in the web application, add this session management information. For example, it could be a session ID, session token or cookie information.

  

**Adjusting Advanced Settings** : You can configure advanced settings to customize scanning behavior and scanned targets. This allows you to control the scope and depth of the scan.

  

**Browser ID Identification** : Specify Acunetix's browser ID. This can help simulate that requests to the web application are coming from a real user's browser.

  

**Specifying Scope Between Targets** : Determine the scan scope. You can use this feature to determine which URLs or pages to crawl and which to exclude.

  

**HTTP Authentication Settings** : If your web application requires HTTP authentication, make the relevant authentication settings. This helps Acunetix meet authentication requirements.

  

**Automatic Session Management Settings** : Acunetix has session management automating capabilities. This allows it to handle logins automatically through the browser.

  

**Settings**

The settings in the Settings section of the Acunetix Discovery menu control the automatic discovery of Acunetix's web applications and services. These settings determine the number and scope of web applications to be discovered and the speed and sensitivity of the discovery process.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti40.png)

  
  

The options and their functions in this menu are as follows:

  

**Email Matching:** When this option is enabled, Acunetix matches web applications using the second-level domain name in the user's email address.

  

**Website Matching:** When this option is enabled, Acunetix matches web applications using domain names of web applications previously discovered by the user.

  

**Only Registered Domains:** This option ensures that discovery only discovers web applications and services that contain registered domains. When this option is enabled, discovery ignores web applications and services that contain domains that are not yet registered or are registered but not in use.

  

**Reverse IP Address Lookup:** When this option is enabled, Acunetix matches web applications using the user's IP address.

  

**Organization Name Matching:** When this option is enabled, Acunetix matches web applications using the name of the user's organization.

  

**Inclusions**

The Inclusions menu is used to control the scope of Acunetix Discovery's discovery process. This menu can be used to add domain names, IP addresses, and organization names that the discovery process will consider.

I nclusions menu contains the following settings:

  

**Second-Level Domain Names:** In this field, it is possible to add second-level domain names that the discovery process will take into account.

  

**Top-Level Domains:** In this field it is possible to add top-level domains that the discovery process will take into account.

  

**Organization Names:** In this field, it is possible to add organization names that the discovery process will take into account.

  

**IP Addresses:** In this field, it is possible to add the IP addresses that the discovery process will take into account.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti41.png)

  
  

For example, if you are an e-commerce company, you can use the Inclusions menu to explore just your own domain and subdomains. This will increase the speed of the discovery process and ensure that only your company's web applications and services are discovered.

Or, if you are a government agency, you can use the Inclusions menu to explore government-only domains. This will further narrow the scope of the discovery process and ensure that it only discovers government web applications and services.

  

**Exclusions**

The exclusions menu works the opposite of the inclusions menu. The main difference between the two menus is that the Inclusions menu expands the scope of the discovery process, while the Exclusions menu narrows the scope of the discovery process. In other words, this menu can be used to add domain names, IP addresses and organization names that the discovery process will not take into account.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti42.png)

  
  

**IP Addresses:** In this field, it is possible to add IP addresses that the discovery process will not take into account.

  

**Organization Names:** In this field, it is possible to add organization names that the discovery process will not take into account.

  

**Top-Level Domains:** In this field it is possible to add top-level domains that the discovery process will not take into account.

  

**Second-Level Domain Names:** In this field, it is possible to add second-level domain names that the discovery process will not take into account.

  

## Targets

The Acunetix Targets menu is used to control Acunetix's crawling of web applications and services. This menu can be used to add, remove and edit web applications and services to scan.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti43.png)

  
  

When we click on the menu, we are greeted with a screen like the one above. On this screen, we can see a list of the targets we have previously covered and scanned, the number of these targets according to the importance of the findings obtained in the scan results, and information about the last scan time and scan status. You can examine the visual below to see which value indicates which level in the area where the numbers are shown according to the importance of the findings.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti44.png)

  
  

Among the buttons you will see at the top right of the screen, only **the Export CSV** option will be active. Thanks to this button, you can print out the list you see on the screen in comma-separated text file format.

Once you select at least one scan result, other options at the top of the screen will also become active.

**the Export to… option,** which is the first among these options, we see the **“Web Application Firewall”** option in the first place , and under this option there are export options for different WAF products. Thanks to these options, we can import the WAF rules regarding vulnerabilities in the scan results in a format suitable for our product and add them to our WAF product. (Depending on the capabilities of our WAF product, there are also options to automate this process and automatically send rules to the WAF product based on scan results.)

**the Export To…** menu are CSV, JSON and XML. Using these options, you can programmatically integrate the exported data into your other security and monitoring products or export it to Excel, etc. You can use it in products.

**the Generate Reports** button, we can access the built-in reports provided by Acunetix and report the scanning results according to different approaches.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti45.png)

  
  

As you can see in the screenshot, it is possible to create outputs in terms of the regulations in force for your business or for developers who develop applications within the institution.

**Delete** Button, you can delete the report or reports you selected.

With the **Group Button, you can group your search results.**

  

## Scans

The Scans menu has almost the same features as the Targets menu, and we also meet **the Stop Scans** , **Delete Scans** and **Compare Scans** options that we do not encounter in the Targets menu.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti46.png)

  
  

**The Stop Scans** option allows us to actively stop scans when we select scans whose status is not Completed.

**The Delete Scans** option allows us to delete the scans we select.

**The Compare Scans** option is a very useful feature that allows you to compare the results of two scans performed on different dates. Thanks to this feature, we can easily monitor how the studies performed between two scans change the results.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti47.png)

  
  

## Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities module is the module where security vulnerabilities detected in scanned Targets are reported.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti48.png)

  
  

We see the severities that we previously explained in the Targets module, with the same color code and description this time, in the first column.

In the second column, we see the name of the vulnerability, and in the third column, we see the URL where the vulnerability was detected.

If a parameter was used to detect the vulnerability in the Parameters column, we see this parameter.

The Status column displays the current status of the vulnerability. Possible values that may appear in this column are as follows:

  

**New:** This means a new vulnerability that Acunetix has not detected before.

**Rediscovered:** This means that a vulnerability that was previously detected and fixed by Acunetix has been detected again.

**Open:** This means the vulnerability has not yet been fixed.

**Fixed:** This means the vulnerability has been fixed.

**Not a vulnerability:** This means the vulnerability is not a real vulnerability.

**False positive:** This means the vulnerability was incorrectly detected.

  

In the next column, the Confidence Column, we see a % detail about how confident Acunetix is about the validity of the vulnerability it detected. 100% indicates that the vulnerability is definitely valid, while 50% indicates that Acunetix is not very confident about the outcome.

The Last Seen column shows the date when the finding was last detected.

  

## Scan Profiles

At the bottom right of the main menu on the left are the Scan Profiles settings. In this module, just as there are many scan profiles that come by default with Acunetix, we can create our own custom profiles by clicking the " **Add New Profile " button in the upper right corner.**

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Vulnerability+Management/6/cti50.png)

  
  

While creating our own profiles, we can proceed by selecting the ones we need from the ready-made scripts in Acunetix or write our own scripts.

## WAF

Finally, we can use this menu for WAF integration, which we mentioned before in the Targets and Scans modules. Thanks to this menu, we can, for example, integrate our Acunetix into Amazon Cloud Front and enable our WAF product to automatically mitigation based on our scanning results.
