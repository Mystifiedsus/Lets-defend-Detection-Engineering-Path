### Introduction to Bash

## History Of Bash

The Unix shell serves as an interface that allows users to interact with operating systems. This shell receives the user's commands and passes those commands to the operating system. Shell is both a scripting language and a program capable of interpreting commands.

  

The first Unix shell was developed by Stephen R. Bourne, one of the original creators of Unix, in 1979, and was therefore named Bourne Shell. The Bourne shell (`sh`) became the most widely used shell on Unix and Unix-like systems.

  

In the mid-1980s, Brian Fox developed Bash (Bourne Again Shell) for the GNU project with the aim of replacing Bourne Shell. Bash is a shell that encompasses the features of Bourne Shell but also provides more advanced features and a user-friendly interface. Bash is used as the standard shell for many Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.

  

The development of Bash continued with the fixing of various bugs as well as adding new features such as command line editing, shell job control, shell functions, and many more.

  

We can say that Bash is the tool of choice by many system administrators and developers, as it proves the importance and flexibility of the shell and also makes it easy to write scripts. This has made Bash frequently used, especially in system administration and automated tasks.

  

  

## Cons and Pros

Because Bash was created in the UNIX systems, it has the inherent robustness and problem-solving abilities of that environment. Let's take a look at the strengths that characterize Bash:

  

**Works Anywhere**

You can find Bash almost anywhere. It works on Linux, Mac, and even Windows (thanks to the Windows Subsystem for Linux). In fact, there is a BASH in your car and on your TV at home, even if you don't see it. This means that the scripts you write will work on almost any platform.

  

**Automation Capabilities**

Bash is the number one method to automate tasks. It is a powerful tool which you can get repetitive tasks done. Using Bash's capabilities is a great way to save time and reduce errors.

  

**Productivity**

Thanks to Bash, you have the ability to combine complex commands and perform many tasks at once. This helps you to be more productive.

  

**Integration Capability with Many Different Tools**

Bash integrates with many Unix commands and tools perfectly. This allows you to perform more complex operations and use many different tools in the same script.

  

We've seen Bash's strengths above. Unfortunately, it also has some weaknesses. Before listing them, let's point out that Bash is actually excellent as a system management tool, its disadvantages appear when compared to other modern scripting languages:

  

**Complexity**

Bash can be a bit complex, especially for beginners. Its syntax can be a bit odd and difficult to remember from time to time.

  

**Debugging:** Debugging Bash can be a bit of a hassle. Bash usually does not display the line number with error, and so this makes it difficult to find errors.

  

**Performance**

Bash is a bit slower in terms of performance compared to other languages. While this is not usually a problem, it may be from time to time when working with very large datasets or when you need to perform tasks very quickly.

  

**Advanced Features**

Bash does not have some advanced features that languages like Python or JavaScript offer. For instance, Bash lacks features like first-class functions, data structures, etc.

  

To summarize, Bash is a great option in many cases, especially for tasks related to system administration and automation. However, other languages may be more suitable for certain situations and requirements.

  

## Terminology

In this section, let's explain some very basic concepts for those unfamiliar with the Unix world. These will make the later stages of the course more understandable.

  

**Shell**

Shell allows users to communicate with the operating system. Shell is a type of user interface and is usually text-based. Shells also feature a scripting language and allow users to save commands as a written script and run this script automatically later. Bash is one of the most popular Unix shells and often comes as the default shell on Linux and macOS.

  

**Command Line (CLI)**

The command line is an interface where users enter commands into the shell. It is usually accessed via a terminal or console application. Users tell the operating system what to do by typing text-based commands and pressing “Enter”.

  

**Command**

A command is an instruction given to the operating system to perform a certain action. For example, `ls` is a Unix command that lists files and directories in the current directory to the user. `cd` is another command and it changes the current working directory.

  

**Script**

A script is an automated set of commands. These commands are stored in a file and then interpreted and executed by the shell. Bash scripts are usually stored in files ending with the `.sh` extension and can contain a number of command and control structures (if-else constructs, loops, etc.).

  

**Pipelining**

Pipelining is the ability to use the output of one command as the input of another command. This is done with the `|` symbol. For example, `ls | The grep .txt` command passes the output of the `ls` command to the `grep` command and lists only files with the `.txt` extension.

  

**Environment Variables**

Environment variables allow the shell and the programs it runs to store and access certain values. For example, the `PATH` environment variable specifies which directories the shell will check for commands. These environment variables can be set system-wide or for a specific user.

  

**STDIN, STDOUT ve STDERR**

These terms refer to standard channels for the input and output of the shell and programs. STDIN usually represents input from the keyboard, STDOUT represents correct output and STDERR represents erroneous output.

  

**Execution Permissions**

On Unix-based systems, it determines whether a file or script is executable. These permissions can be changed with the `chmod` command.

  

These terms are some of the basic concepts you will encounter in the Bash and general Unix world. Understanding them is an essential part of working effectively on a Unix-based system and writing Bash scripts.

  

## Hello World

Let's write a little bash script together:

  

First, open a text editor. On Linux it can usually be `nano`, `vi` or `emacs`. On Windows you can use Notepad or another text editor. Basically, what we're going to do is create a text file with .sh extension

  

Type the following two lines in the text editor:

                    `#!/bin/bash echo "Hello World"`

                    
                  Copy

The `#!/bin/bash` line indicates that this script should be run in Bash.

The `echo` command, on the other hand, prints text to the screen.

  

Save this file as **hello_word.sh** .

  

Now we have to make sure the script is executable. We can do this by running the following command in terminal:

                    `chmod +x hello_word.sh`

                    
                  Copy

This command adds executable permissions to `hello_world.sh`.

  

Finally, we can run our script:

                    `./hello_word.sh`

                    
                  Copy

What do you see on the screen?

  

We've made a basic example of creating and running a simple "Hello Word" script in Bash. This script is a great starting point for demonstrating the simplicity and ease of use of the Bash scripting language.

### Setting up the Bash Environment

Bash comes installed on almost all Linux, Unix, BSD, and MacOS platforms and is often the default shell application. Some of these systems (i.e. Kali Linux) default to ZSH etc. Although shell environments are used, all the packages you need to use bash are available in the system, and you can drop into bash shell by simply typing bash and pressing enter. We should also note that bash scripts will often run smoothly under shells like “zsh”, and etc.

  

In Windows environments, bash is not included by default, but there are multiple ways to use bash on Windows operating systems. Let's take a look at them now:

  

## WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Microsoft offers the Windows Subsystem for Linux feature on Windows 10 and later that lets users run Linux operating systems directly. This feature is one of the ways we can use Bash on Windows systems. In order to use this feature, there are a series of installation and settings that we need to configure.

  

First, we need to open a PowerShell console with Administrator rights and run the following command and wait for the installation to complete:

                    `wsl --install`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopy

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash49.png)

  
  

After the installation is complete, you can access your Linux environment by locating the Ubuntu application from the Start menu and running it. However, in some cases, you are likely to receive an error message like the one below.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash50.png)

  
  

If you are getting this error message, you can try two things. First to find and activate the "Virtualization Support" option in your computer's BIOS settings. If your problem is not solved even after doing this, you can restart your computer after running the following commands:

                    `DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopy

                    `bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopy

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash51.png)

  
  

If everything went well and your Ubuntu System started working fine on WSL, it will ask us to define a username and password before it starts the bash console.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash52.png)

  
  

We need to make a file system related reminder. Ubuntu WSL runs on its own virtual file system. It mounts the file systems of your Windows under the /mnt/ directory. So, if you want to view the files and directories on the C:/ disk of your Windows system, you need to run the ls /mnt/c command. This is an important case you should consider while writing and running your scripts.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash53.png)

  
  

On Windows, to access your home directory in Ubuntu WSL environment, you should use “ **explorer.exe .** ” (note the dot at the end) in your home directory and press enter.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash54.png)

  
  

## CygWIN

Cygwin is a software package designed to provide a POSIX compliant environment on Windows operating systems. POSIX is a set of standards that define how an operating system should work, and most Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD, etc.) follow these standards.

  

Cygwin includes a library (cygwin1.dll) that translates POSIX APIs to Windows APIs, and many GNU and open-source applications which make these applications can run natively on Windows.

  

Many Unix/Linux commands and services (for example, bash shell, ssh, tar, awk, make, grep, and more) become available on Windows with Cygwin. You can also compile and run Unix/Linux programs on Windows with Cygwin.

  

To explain how Cygwin works in details; Cygwin is a tool that allows Unix/Linux applications that know how to perform Unix/Linux operating system calls (for example, opening a file or creating a process), and these applications convert these to a format that Windows understands.

  

This makes the application feel "as if" it is running in a Unix/Linux environment. However, this type of conversion may not always be perfect and can sometimes cause applications to behave in unexpected ways.

  

To install Cygwin, you need to download and run setup-x86.exe (for 32-bit systems) or setup-x86_64.exe (for 64-bit systems) from the Cygwin website ( [https://www.cygwin.com](https://www.cygwin.com/) ). During the installation, you can choose which packages to install. For the bash shell and some basic tools, the default options are usually sufficient. After the installation is complete, you can start Cygwin and use the bash shell.

  

Now let's take a look at the installation steps:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash55.png)

  
  

After the welcome screen, we’ll see the options on how to download the files and how to install them. We can proceed with the default option.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash56.png)

  
  

In the next step, we need to select where to install CygWIN. We recommend leaving it as default.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash57.png)

  
  

In the next step, we need to select the “Local Package Directory” settings. This’ll be the directory where the packages will be downloaded. It is important for your security that you select a directory where only your account can access will provide you with security. If you don't need anything different, you can also leave this as default:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash58.png)

  
  

In the next step, we need to select where we want to download the packages from. You can pretty much select any download sites in the options but in cases where your connection is slow, you may need choose a mirror within your own country. Or if you have restricted access to some countries, you can choose a mirror from a non-restricted country, usually just click on any of them:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash59.png)

  
  

In the next step, you need to select the applications and packages you want to use with CygWIN. Here, we have selected the current versions of **Bash** related packages under **Shells** . But keep it in mind that we will need many more packages for a comfortable workspace.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash60.png)

  
  

And now, the installation can begin:

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash61.png)

  
  

When the installation process is complete, you can access your shell by clicking one of the **Cygwin64 Terminal** icons placed on your desktop and start menu.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash62.png)

  
  

As you can see, it is possible to use Bash on Windows systems as well. It takes some time to get used to it to be able to use it effectively, but considering its capabilities, it's well worth it.

  

Now let's go ahead and see what we can do with Bash.

### Basics of Bash Scripting

In this section, we will see the basic concepts we need to know in order to write Bash scripts and how to use them.

  

## Variables

As in all programming/scripting languages, the use of variables is critical in Bash. You can think of variables simply as containers where we store some data for later use. In Bash, we can handle variables under two different headings:

  

## Normal Variables

Defining a variable in Bash is pretty straightforward. All you have to do is specify the variable name and assign a value with an equal sign (=). For example:

  

In this example, we created a variable named `our_variable` and assigned the value "Hello World" to it.

  

To use the value of a variable, we put a dollar sign (`$`) in front of the variable name:

  

This command prints the value of `our_variable` i.e., "Hello World".

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash1.png)

  
  

Note that this definition is valid throughout the console session we are working on. We cannot access the value of this variable when we open a new console.

  

If we want to define a variable that can be accessed from anywhere during a user's session, we need to use environmental variables.

  

  

## Environmental Variables

Environmental variables are variables that exist throughout a particular shell session and usually contain system information, user settings, or information needed for programs to run.

The names of environmental variables are usually capitalized, although not required. For example, the `PATH` environment variable specifies which directories the shell should check to look for commands.

  

To read an environmental variable, we put a dollar sign (`$`) like a regular variable:

                    `echo $PATH`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

This command prints the value of the `PATH` environmental variable to the screen.

  

To create or modify an environmental variable, we use the `export` command:

                    `export NEW_VARIABLE="Hello World, Again…"`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

In this example, we created an environmental variable named `NEW_VARIABLE` and assigned it the value "Hello World, Again...". This environment variable will be available throughout the current shell session and can be read by other programs.

  

Variables and environment variables are some of the most important concepts in Bash scripts and they make Bash scripts dynamic and interactive.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash2.png)

  
  

As you can see in the example in the screenshot, it is also possible to see a list of all valid environmental variables in our active session with the "env" command in the Linux command line.

  

## Scope in variables

The variables we use within a Bash script have scopes. These are “Local” and “Global” scopes.

“Global Variables” are variables that can be accessed from anywhere within a script.

“Local Variables” are variables valid only within the “Function” in which they are used.

In the future, we will refer to this subject again when we cover the “Functions” subject.

  

## Control Structures

Bash is a very useful tool for automating our tasks. However, there are times when we want to be able to do more than just do everything on a one-way, fixed path. This is where control structures come into play!

  

Control structures allow our script to follow different paths for different conditions. Let's say you want to check if a file exists. Here you can use the "if" control structure. The "if" constructs in Bash work just like any other programming language. If a certain condition is true, it executes a certain block of code.

  

Loops are also part of control structures. Let's say you want to list all files in a directory and do a specific action for each one. You can use the "for" loop here. This repeatedly runs a given block of code on an array element.

  

Control structures which make our scripts smarter and more flexible bring out the real power in Bash scripts. They also allow us to automate more complex processes. So, control structures in Bash allow us to do things not only faster, but also smarter!

  

Now, let's examine the control structures in Bash one by one:

  

## “if-else-if” Structure

This build checks whether a certain condition is true and runs different commands accordingly.

For example, in this example, it asks the user to enter a number, assigns the user-entered value to a variable, and then checks whether the value of this variable:

- is greater than 10,
- is equal to 10, or,
- is less than 10.

  

  

Note that we're not yet checking if the value from the user is an integer or not here.

                    `#!/bin/bash echo "Please Input Number:" read variable_number  if [ "$variable_number" -gt "10" ] then     echo "The number you entered is GREATER THAN 10" elif [ "$variable_number" -eq "10" ] then     echo "The number you entered is EQUAL TO 10" else     echo "The number you entered is LESS THAN 10" fi`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash4.png)

  
  

In the example above, we used the comparison operators "If Equal", "If Greater", and "If Less Than". The table below lists all the standard comparison operators you can use in Bash. You should pay special attention to the different ways of checking for equality for data types "String" and "Integer":

### Loops

## “For” Loop

This loop executes certain commands on an array of elements. For example:

                    `#!/bin/bash  for count_variable in 1 2 3 4 5 do     echo "Current Value: $count_variable" done`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

In this example, we created a loop through the numbers 1 to 5 and print the value for each one.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash6.png)

  
  

“For” structure of the Bash scripting doesn't just use the integer arrays we used in this example. For “for loop”, we can use strings, files and directories on the filesystem, or the output of any command as a string.

                    `#!/bin/bash  for count_variable in 1 2 3 4 5 do     echo "Current Value: $count_variable" done  for string_variable in Torvalds Stallman Raymond Linux Bash do     echo "$string_variable is Great" done  for filesystem_variable in /home/letsdefend/ex* do     echo "Example File: $filesystem_variable" done  for output_variable in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd) do     echo "User in Passwd File: $output_variable" done`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

Now let's look at the output of this script:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash8.png)

  
  

As you can see in this example, you can easily interact with the operating system from within Bash scripts.

  

## “While” Loop

“While” loop runs certain commands as long as a certain condition is true. For example:

                    `#!/bin/bash  our_variable=1 while [ $our_variable -le 5 ] do     echo "Value: $our_variable"     ((our_variable++)) done`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

In this example, we created a loop as long as the value of the variable is less than or equal to 5. Then, in the "While" loop we started, we print the value to the screen in each loop and increase the value of our variable by 1. And here is the result:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash10.png)

  
  

In the example above, we did only a numerical check with "While" and we can do even more.

  

In the example below:

- First, we specify a “requested_value” (“Yes”)
- Next, we start a loop that will continue as long as the "requested_value" value is "Yes".
- We request an input from the user for each round of the loop.
- The loop continues until the user provides an input other than "Yes"

                    `#!/bin/bash requested_value="Yes" while [ "$requested_value" = "Yes" ] do    echo "While is working..."    echo "Do you want to continue? (Yes/No)"    read requested_value done`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash12.png)

  
  

Let's do another example. For this example, let's create a loop that continues unless there is a file named "test.txt" under the "/tmp" directory:

                    `#!/bin/bash while [ ! -f /tmp/test.txt ] do    echo "Loop Working..."    sleep 10 done echo "File Found, Done."`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

When we run the script, the loop continues until we create the "test.txt" file in the "/tmp" directory and ends when we create the file:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash14.png)

  
  

## “Case” Structure

Now let's examine another control structure, the "case".

“Case” allows us to perform different operations according to the different values that a variable can take.

It is particularly useful in different circumstances, when we need to branch into different subroutines.

Note that we mark every case with a “*” that does not meet the conditions we set in the example below.

                    `#!/bin/bash  echo "Please input value" read our_variable  case $our_variable in     1 )         echo "our_variable value is Equal To 1"         ;;     2 )         echo "our_variable value is Equal To 2"         ;;     * )         echo "our_variable value is NOT Equal To 1 or 2"         ;; esac`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

In this example, we check if the value of the variable is equal to 1 or 2, and display different messages accordingly:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Bash-scripting/bash100.png)

  
  

These structures are the basic control structures of the Bash scripting language and allow you to perform a wide variety of logical operations within a Bash script.

### Functions

In the Bash scripting language, functions represent the name of a block of code that performs a specific function. Thanks to their versatile capabilities, functions help us organize our scripts, reuse our code, and generally make our lives easier.

  

When we need to repeat an action multiple times, we can put it in a function and call it in anywhere in our script. This way, we don't have to write the same code over and over, which makes our code cleaner and more manageable. More importantly, when we need to make a change, we only need to make it in one place, in the function itself.

  

Bash functions can take parameters and output them. In this way, they allow us to perform a certain action based on a certain input or use the result of an action elsewhere.

  

A Bash function can be defined as follows:

                    `function_name() {     Commands }`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

For example, we could create a "hello" function and have it take a name parameter:

                    `hello() {     echo "Hello, $1!" }`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

To call this function, we can do as follows:

                    `Hello "Bash"`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

As you can imagine, you can create any number of functions in a script and call them whenever you want. It is even possible to call a function from within another function. Below is an example of this.

  

- First, we define the “add” function. This function adds the two values sent to itself and returns the result.
- Then, we define the "multiply" function. This function multiplies the two values sent to itself and returns the result.
- Finally, we define the "calculate" function. This function, on the other hand, sends the values sent to itself to both the "add" and "multiply" functions and writes the results to the screen.

                    `#!/bin/bash  # A function that adds two numbers add() {     local result=$(( $1 + $2 ))     echo $result }  # A function that multiplies two numbers multiply() {     local result=$(( $1 * $2 ))     echo $result }  # A function that uses both add and multiply functions calculate() {     local sum=$(add $1 $2)     local product=$(multiply $1 $2)     echo "The sum of $1 and $2 is $sum."     echo "The product of $1 and $2 is $product." }  # Call the calculate function calculate 5 3`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

In the example code above, did you notice something?

You've seen the term "local" for the first time. Those of you who are careful have noticed right away that it is related with the "local" and "global" variables we talked about in "Variables".

                    `#!/bin/bash  # Global variable greeting="Hello, World!"  function displayGreeting {     # Local variable     local greeting="Hello, User!"     echo $greeting # This will print "Hello, User!" because local variable takes precedence in this scope }  # Call the function displayGreeting  # Print the global variable echo $greeting # This will print "Hello, World!" because the scope here has only access to the global variable`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

First, we create a global variable called 'greeting'. This variable can be accessed from anywhere - inside or outside any function. We assign the "Hello, World!" value to this variable. So whenever we say 'greeting', we will receive the "Hello, World!" output.

  

Then we create a function called 'displayGreeting'. Inside this function, we create another variable called 'greeting'. But this time, we define the variable with the 'local' keyword, which means it is valid only inside this function, not outside of this function. We assign the "Hello, User!" value to this local 'greeting'.

  

So what happens when we call the 'displayGreeting' function? The 'echo $greeting' code inside the function runs and says "Hello, User!" he greets us. Because the local variable inside the function rises above the global variable with the same name.

  

After calling the function, we say 'echo $greeting' once again. This time, however, we receive the "Hello, World!" greeting as the 'greeting' variable is global and the scope of the local version is just the 'displayGreeting' function, so it takes the value of the global version:

To summarize, functions are extremely useful tools in the Bash scripting language. We can write more effective, efficient and organized scripts with the help of functions.

### Error Handling

As in all programming/scripting languages, error management is very important in Bash scripting and should never be ignored.

  

Good error handling helps your script better handle unexpected situations, which increases its overall reliability. You want your script to run properly, not when everything is going well, but also when errors and unexpected situations occur.

  

If your script generates helpful error messages in the event of an error, it's easier to identify where and why errors occur. This can greatly facilitate debugging especially large and complex scripts.

  

It definitely creates a better user experience for the end users if your script handles errors properly and provides helpful error messages. Error messages can help the user understand what went wrong and possibly what to do.

  

In some cases, errors may lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, your script may run in unpredictable or undesirable ways and produce unwanted results if it is trying to read a file when a proper file is not available and if your script is not able to exit properly in case of an error.

  

An unexpected error can stop or slow down automated business processes. This can affect large number of users and business processes, especially in large-scale systems or environment. For this reason, it is very important to effectively manage errors to ensure the business continuity.

  

## Error Catching

In the Bash scripting, you can use the `$?` variable to check the status of your script and catch errors. This variable stores the exit status of the last command executed. Generally, `0` represents a successful exit, while any value other than “0” indicates an error condition.

  

As an example, let's consider a script that tries to delete a file. If you try to delete the file without checking whether it exists, this may generate an error condition. We can use the variable `$?` to control this situation:

  

**#!/bin/bash**

                    `#!/bin/bash  rm some_file.txt if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then     echo "Failed to delete the file"     exit 1 fi`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

Some of you may wonder why you need this in the script as we already get an error message when the script is run. The answer is simple. We may not notice the “rm: cannot remove 'some_file.txt': No such file or directory” message that the operating system displays on the screen in our script and control the flow of our program accordingly. But we can easily notice that an error has occurred when we check the script for errors. For example, in the code below, we create the file if there is none exists:

                    `#!/bin/bash  rm some_file.txt if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then     echo "Failed to delete the file because it does not exist, creating the file now..."     touch some_file.txt fi`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

## Debugging

There are several ways to debug in the Bash scripting. The simplest way is to add `echo` commands to the highlights of your script. This way you can see at what point the script is and which variables have which values. However, this method may cause to lose the control easily in complex scripts.

  

Instead, you can use the debug mode of the Bash scripting. You can start bash in debug mode using the `-x` parameter:

                    `#!/bin/bash set -x # turn on trace mode  # some operations echo "This is a test" var="Hello, World!" echo $var  set +x # turn off trace mode`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

In this mode, the Bash prints each command to the screen and moves to the next line after the command is executed. This allows you to follow what the script is doing and identify where the errors occur step-by-step.

Another debugging method is to use set -e (or bash -e). set -e (or bash -e) causes the script to stop when the return value of any command in the Bash script is non-zero (it means if the script fails). This is helpful to prevent the uncontrolled spread of bugs. Under normal circumstances, if an error occurs in any line while executing a script, Bash continues from the next line. “-e” is a life-saving option in cases where it is not wanted for the script to continue despite the error.

                    `#!/bin/bash set -e  # stop script execution on failure  # This command will succeed echo "This command will succeed" var="Hello, World!" echo $var  # This command will fail (assuming file_does_not_exist.txt does not exist) echo "Trying to display the contents of a file that does not exist..." cat file_does_not_exist.txt  echo "This message will not be printed because the script already exited"`
                    
                  CopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopyCopy

As you can see, the script exits before the last line since we are using "-e":
