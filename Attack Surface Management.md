### What is Attack Surface?

The attack surface is simply your whole entire inventory. All the software, hardware, IOT devices, and even your human resources that you use within the organization are included in the concept of attack surface.

  

## What is Attack Surface Management?

Attack Surface Management is a security approach used to monitor, evaluate and reduce the exposure of an organization's information systems, networks and applications to potential attacks. This approach plays an important role in cybersecurity because an organization's attack surface includes all potential entry points and weaknesses that attackers can use when selecting targets or attempting cyberattacks.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the Attack Surface and its management. We will be learning about the “ **Understanding Attack Surface Management (ASM)** ” topic.

### Understanding Attack Surface Management (ASM)

Attack Surface Management (ASM) basically consists of the following steps, even though it may require different steps and approaches depending on the structure of an organization:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Attack+Surface+Management/2/asm1.png)

  
  

**Asset Discovery**

We first need to know what to protect from the cybersecurity perspective. We make a list of all the assets (servers, network devices, applications, databases, IoT devices, etc.) during the asset discovery step.

  

**Risk Assessment**

We start the risk assessment by making a list of the assets we own. In the second step, we need to analyze all these assets and their security status, identify and document the particular weaknesses of each.

  

**Reducing the Attack Surface**

After risk assessment, we can begin to reduce the attack surface by taking measures such as shutting down unnecessary or potentially risky assets, disabling unnecessary services, or uninstalling unnecessary applications.

  

**Continuous Monitoring**

The first three items should be a continuous living process, not a one-time task. It is necessary to constantly monitor the attack surface and keep track of new assets, security updates and vulnerabilities, constantly applying the entire chain.

  

**Automation**

Steps such as risk assessment and continuous monitoring require a lot of attention, effort and time and they are prone to errors. It is possible, and in fact necessary, to make continuous monitoring and risk assessment processes more effective by using automation tools.

  

## Why is Attack Surface Management (ASM) Important?

The width of your attack surface helps attackers identify their targets. What you should not forget is that in the first stage of Cyber Kill Chain, attackers make discoveries about you.

By assessing the attack surface of their targets, attackers determine which systems and applications they should focus on.

If attackers detect your weaknesses before you do, it increases the likelihood of attacks being successful. Additionally, the larger the surface exposed to attack, the more likely attackers are to succeed.

The larger the surface exposed to attack, the greater the cyber risk.

  

## What are the Benefits of Attack Surface Management (ASM)?

Proper Attack Surface Management (ASM) provides numerous benefits to organizations. Let's take a look at the most prominent ones:

  

**Reduces the Risk of Cyber Attacks**

ASM practices reduce an organization's attack surface, provide protection for cyber attacks. A goos Attack Surface Management will reduce the likelihood of attackers to succeed. ASM applications analyze all systems, networks and applications of an organization and detect security vulnerabilities and risky situations. In line with these findings, the organization can reduce the risk of attack by taking the necessary precautions. The most important contribution to you and your organization is to be aware of existing vulnerabilities before attackers do.

  

**Prevents Data Loss and Financial Loss**

Cyber attacks can cause data loss and financial loss. ASM practices help prevent these losses. ASM applications detect security vulnerabilities and risky situations and ensure that precautions are taken against these situations. In this way, data loss and financial losses can be prevented. Researches show that organizations affected by a cyber attack will take up to 30 days to recover their lost data.

  

**Protects Organizational Reputation**

Cyber attacks can seriously damage an organization's reputation. A good attack surface management practice will help prevent this. ASM applications reduce an organization's cybersecurity risks, making attacks less likely to be successful. In this way, the reputation of the organization can be protected. What you should remember is that restoring lost trust is more difficult than recovering the data and the financial losses. Loss of trust and reputation will also return to you as financial loss in the long term.

  

**Increases the Trust of Customers and Business Partners**

Customers and business partners trust organizations with a strong cybersecurity structure. ASM practices help increase this trust. ASM applications reduce an organization's cybersecurity risks, ensuring that customers' and business partners' data is safe. You can ensure the trust of your business partners by explaining your ASM applications together with other security applications.

  

## Attack Surface Management (ASM) Tools and Techniques

Determining the attack surface is the first step in understanding an organization's cybersecurity posture. Variety of applications are available depending on the dynamics of each organization, but the essential basic resources that can be applied in all organizations are as follows:

  

**System and Application Scans**

System and application scans analyze all systems and applications of an organization and detect security vulnerabilities and risky situations. These scans can be done automatically or manually. Outputs obtained using one or more tools can be evaluated. The important thing at this point is to have access to the entire inventory within the organization and to be sure that there is no system or application outside the scope of these scans. Therefore, when performing this type of scanning, whether manual or automatic, it is critical to ensure that the scanning reaches all segments and endpoints in our network.

Asset discovery tools can be used to perform these scans regularly and automatically. Asset Discovery tools are very useful tools for detecting all systems, networks and applications of an organization.

Similarly, Vulnerability Scanning tools are also very useful and functional tools to automatically detect vulnerabilities in an organization's systems and applications.

  

**Asset Reduction**

You need to identify and shut down assets within your organization that pose potential risks, such as unnecessary or unused computers, servers, software or services. This, in addition to narrowing the surface open to cyber attack, will help reducing the maintenance and security costs of the organization.

  

**Turning Off Unnecessary Services**

You need to turn off unnecessary network services, services and ports within your organization. This narrows the network surface that attackers can access and makes the organization less susceptible to attacks.

  

**Uninstalling Unnecessary Apps**

On systems in your organization, you need to remove software applications that were installed in some way but are no longer used or updated. Such applications can be a potential vulnerability for cyber attacks.

  

**Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation**

The process of reducing the attack surface is a continuous and living process. Therefore, you need to monitor your assets constantly and evaluate them along with the services and applications. In this context, it is very important that you constantly and carefully follow the security bulletins published by the software manufacturers.

  

**System and Application Records**

Knowing the list of systems and applications we have and the risks they pose is good, but unfortunately it is not enough. The records created during the operation of these applications and systems provide very useful data to manage our attack surface and identify risks.

  

**Network Scanning and Analysis Tools**

Network scanning and analysis tools detect suspicious activities by analyzing an organization's network traffic. These tools help detect attackers' movements on the network. The list of systems and applications we identified in the previous article is good for a start, but knowing them is not enough to keep us safe. Let's say we detect a server during our system and application scana and a file sharing application is running on it. In the risk analysis step, we see that the operating system on our server is up to date, security hardening steps have been implemented, and we found no known vulnerabilities on the file sharing application that runs on the system. So far, everything looks ok. But there is a detail that we should not overlook, and that is the potential emergence of a zero-day vulnerability in that application or operating system we use. In order to predict this and similar unexpected situations, network analysis tools are critical importance. Constant network and asset monitoring will help us catch suspicious events that we have not encountered before and can save us from potential incidents.

  

**Threat Intelligence Tools**

Threat intelligence tools will not only track the attacks aimed at your organization, but they will track all cyber threats and attacks in the world and share their findings with you through automations/reports. These findings will allow you to be aware of the activities of known threat actors against your organization as they evaluate the data collected in the network analysis step we explained in the previous article and the records of the firewall and other security products to be mentioned in the next step.

  

**Firewall & Security Tools Logs**

Logs of security tools within the organization, especially the Firewall, record what is happening in an organization's network. More importantly, it is one of the most important points where we can obtain detailed information about the organization’s communication with the outside world. These records can give us great clues from the attackers' discovery stage and can be used to detect their movements on the network.

  

**Personnel Training Surveys**

Personnel surveys help measure employees' cybersecurity awareness. These surveys help employees understand how to defend against cyber attacks. Trainings are indispensable to develop this awareness.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the attack surface management steps, its importance, benefits and tools & techniques. We will keep learning about the “ **Attack Surface Management with Open Source Tools** ” in the next part of our training.

### Attack Surface Management with Open Source Tools - 1

Nowadays, there are many products and services available for Attack Surface Management. While some of these are paid commercial products, some are open source products.

In this lesson, we will give you ideas about Open Source tools you can use for ASM.

  

## OWASP AMASS

OWASP AMASS Project is a tool that promises to perform network mapping of attack surfaces and external asset discovery using open source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques.

It can collect and report a lot of information on different topics by integrating with different sources.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Attack+Surface+Management/3/asm_new1.png)

  
  

AMASS is available as ready-compiled packages for Linux, MacOs and Windows platforms, and is also distributed as source code. When we first run the console-based application, we are greeted with a screen like below:

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Attack+Surface+Management/3/asm2.png)

  
  

When we asked AMASS to enumerate the google.com domain, the output we got was as follows:

## NUCLEI

Nuclei is a fast scanner for scanning modern applications, infrastructures, cloud environments and networks. It helps you find and fix security vulnerabilities quickly.

It basically works with templates which are simple YAML files that define how to detect, prioritize, and remediate specific vulnerabilities.

Nuclei has a very active ecosystem. In this way, hundreds of security researchers and engineers contribute to the template ecosystem, and these templates are regularly available and updated within the Nuclei tool.

More than 5000 templates have been added until the date of preparation of this course. These templates include real-world attacks and the latest attack vectors; among these, we can give Log4j vulnerability, GitLab RCE as examples and there are many more. This dynamic structure of the Nuclei ecosystem is very important today, where attackers' techniques and tactics are replaced by new ones every day.

A simple template example is as follows:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Attack+Surface+Management/3/asm4.png)

  
  

Each template represents a potential attack vector and includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, its severity, priority score, and sometimes even commonly used attacks. The template-driven approach not only adds flexibility, but also points that the vulnerabilities detected by Nuclei have real-world usability, not just theoretical risks.

Thanks to this template structure, you can also write your own templates regarding the critical points of your own special applications.

The below table on Nuclei's website shows where it can be used:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Attack+Surface+Management/3/asm10.png)

  
  

The product, which produces such a wide range of outputs will produce very useful outputs for us to make discoveries about our attack surface.
