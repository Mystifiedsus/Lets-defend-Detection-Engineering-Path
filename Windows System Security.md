### Windows System Security Fundamentals

Businesses and individuals are increasingly reliant on platforms and operating systems to process, store and access their data. However, this dependence brings with it the need to significantly increase the security of systems.

Windows Operating system is one of the platforms that is widely used and system security is the cornerstone of its information security. Data breaches and cyber attacks are an increasingly significant threat to businesses across all industries. These threats may result in financial losses, disruptions in business processes, data losses and reputational losses.

The security of a Windows system ensures the protection of data and processes, which keeps private and sensitive information of individuals and organizations safe. A secure system prevents service disruptions and protects users against cybercrime. In addition, secure Windows systems ensure that businesses offer a secure digital environment to their customers and employees.

Windows system security is ensured by the combination of a number of components and services. Each of these components plays an important role in improving the security of systems and data. Windows system security basically consists of the following topics:

- User and Group Management
- Active Directory Security
- Windows DNS Security
- Windows DHCP Security
- Windows Local Security Policy, Group Policy, and UAC
- Authentication and Authorization on Windows
- Windows Update and Patch Management
- Antivirus, Malware and Threat Protection
- Windows Log Engine

  

In this part of the training, we have made a general introduction to Windows system security. We will start our training with the “ **User and Group Management** ” topic next.

### User and Group Management

Windows user and group management plays a critical role in keeping Windows systems running securely and efficiently. This lesson will help you understand how both Administrator and Standard user accounts work, how they are managed, and how the privileges can be assigned. You will also learn how the group management can collectively manage the privileges of multiple users.

  

## User Accounts and Management

A user account is an identity defined in Windows for a person or service. Each user account is typically associated with a username and password.

  

**Administrator Accounts**

These accounts provide full access to all system resources and settings. Administrator accounts also have the ability to create, modify, or delete other user accounts.

  

**Standard User Accounts**

These accounts provide users with the ability to run certain programs and manage personal files and settings. However, the ability to change system-wide settings is often limited.

  

For user management in Windows Server;

The Start -> Computer Management -> Local Users and Groups -> Users screen opens:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/image2-1.png)

  
  

The main default users that come with Windows Server are as follows:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/img1.png)

  
  

To create a new local user, right-click on the Users screen, select "New User", type the user information and click the "Create" button.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/image2-2.png)

  
  

We can delete a user account from the system by right-clicking on the user account on the same screen and clicking the "Delete" button.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/image2-3.png)

  
  

So far, we have covered topics like the user management screen on Windows Server, the default users and the features of these users, and how operations such as creating and deleting users.

Below are important points to be considered regarding "User Accounts and Management" in terms of Windows system security:

  

## User Permissions and Authorizations

**Principle of Least Privilege**

Give users only as much authority as necessary which is to create the lowest level of privileges for users.

  

**Limit Administrator Accounts**

Administrator accounts should be used in limited numbers and only when necessary.

  

## Password Policies

**Strong Password Rules**

It must contain at least 12 characters, letters, numbers and special characters.

  

**Mandatory Password Change**

Users must change their passwords periodically.

  

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

Evaluate the usability of 2FA and enable it if possible. This creates an extra layer of security in case a password is compromised.

  

**User Account Control (UAC)**

Enable UAC features so programs and applications can only gain elevated privileges with administrator approval.

  

**Session Timeouts and Screen Locks**

Enable automatic timeout and screen lock features, so their systems are protected when users physically move away from the keyboard.

  

**Account Control and Monitoring**

Enable auditing of user accounts and access. Review logs regularly to identify abnormal or suspicious activity.

  

These precautions are critical to the security of Windows systems. A good user account management practice plays a crucial role in improving system security.

  

## Groups and Management

A group is a collection of one or more users. Groups make it easier to manage users and system resources.

  

**Local Groups**

Groups defined on a computer. Local groups are used to manage resources on a specific computer.

  

**Domain Groups**

Domain groups are used to manage resources across multiple computers on the network.

  

Group members can have certain privileges through group policies. Adding or removing a user from a group is an easy way to quickly change a user's privileges.

The Start -> Computer Management -> Local Users and Groups -> Groups screen opens:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/image2-4.png)

  
  

The default local groups that come with Windows Server are as follows:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/img2.png)

  
  

The default groups that come with the Windows Server Active Directory role are as follows:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/tt1.png)

  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/2/tt2.png)

  
  

Below are important points to be considered regarding "Groups and Management" in terms of Windows system security:

  

**Group Types and Usage**

It is important to determine the types of groups. Windows offers different types of groups such as local, global, and universal. Understanding which type to use and when can improve safety.

  

**Group Access Controls**

Group permissions: Set the access permissions to be assigned to groups according to the least privilege principle. For example, when granting Read and Write Access, carefully determine who gets read and write permissions.

  

## User-Group Relationship

**Adding/Removing Users**

Establish an effective management process to add or remove users from groups as needed.

  

**User Reports**

Review group memberships regularly, check members of each group and keep them up-to-date.

  

## Group Control and Monitoring

**Group Logs**

Review logs regularly for group changes, access requests, and other events.

  

**Regular Review**

Group permissions and memberships should be reviewed at regular intervals.

  

## Group Backup and Recovery

**Group Backups**

Regularly backup configuration settings, especially for important and critical groups.

  

While these topics are important for the security of the group and its members, they are also critical for the overall system security. When groups are managed effectively, this often contributes to a broader understanding of system security.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the management of user and group accounts, and its importance from the Windows System Security aspect. We will learn about the “ **Active Directory Security-1** " in the next part of our training.

### Active Directory Security - 1

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft and used in Windows-based network environments. AD enables centralized management of user accounts, groups, resources, and other network devices. This centralized structure helps ensure network security and data integrity while facilitating users' authentication, authorization processes and access to resources. Active Directory is a critical component that offers organizations efficiency, security and ease of management.

The importance and common usage areas of Active Directory are as follows:

  

**Centralized Identity Management**

Active Directory manages user accounts and credentials centrally. In this way, users can access multiple resources on the network with a single identity. Secure identity management is ensured by centrally managing user accounts, implementing password policies and facilitating authorization processes.

  

**Centralized Management of Resources**

Active Directory provides centralized management of resources on the network. These resources may include user accounts, groups, shared folders, printers, servers, and other network devices. Centralized management of resources facilitates regular configuration and updating of resources and control of access rights.

  

**Security and Access Control**

Active Directory helps enforce security policies on the network. Thanks to authorization and access control mechanisms, users' access levels to certain resources are controlled. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and increases data security.

  

**Group Policies**

One of the most important features of Active Directory is Group Policies. Group Policies are used to centrally manage configuration settings of users and computers. These policies include security settings, desktop settings, application settings, and more. Group Policies provide consistency across the network and make management easier.

  

**Business Continuity and Recovery**

Active Directory plays an important role in ensuring business continuity of organizations. In case of data loss or system failures, it is possible to quickly restore systems using Active Directory's backup and restore mechanisms. This minimizes data loss and allows organizations to continue operating without interruption.

  

**Compliance and Audit**

Many industry standards and regulatory requirements encourage organizations to comply with the auditing capabilities and security features that Active Directory provides. Active Directory facilitates compliance requirements by providing audit trails and tracking mechanisms.

  

Active Directory is a critical component that increases the efficiency of organizations, ensures security and facilitates management. Therefore, many organizations actively use and care about Active Directory.

Domain, Organizational Units (OU), Groups and Objects are some of the major topics that we must know before starting Active Directory security:

  
  

**Domain**

Domain is used as the basic management unit of a network. User accounts, groups, computer accounts and other objects are located in the domain that provides common authentication and access control.

  

**Organizational Unit (OU)**

Organizational Unit (OU) is used to group and manage objects within the domain in a more organized manner. OUs are used for administration, access control, and Group Policy enforcement.

  

**Groups**

Groups are used to logically group users or computers together. Grouping users by similar features or functions makes it easier to manage access rights and permissions.

  

**Objects**

Basic elements in Active Directory. Users, computers, printers, groups, OUs, and other objects form the building blocks of the database in Active Directory.

  

These concepts describe the basic components and structures of Active Directory. Domain provides centralized management of objects and structures and facilitates organization in large networks.

So far, we have talked about the importance of Active Directory, common usage examples and basic things to know about it. Active Directory Security is not just about these topics. Now, let's start talking about "Active Directory Security", and what important points should be considered about it and what precautions should be taken to ensure its security. In addition to these measures, Active Directory Hardening is also recommended.

  

## Use of Default Accounts

"Default Accounts" are accounts that are pre-created by the operating system or applications and usually have a unique username and password. These accounts are created automatically when you install or configure the system or applications. For example, "Administrator" or "Guest" accounts created by the Windows operating system fall into this category. However, the use of these default accounts is generally dangerous in terms of security.

Default accounts often come with basic security settings and may use frequently used passwords or weak security policies. Therefore, using these accounts can create a point that attackers can easily access. Attackers may know the weak security settings and names of default accounts. Attempts to infiltrate systems and attacks can be carried out by targeting these accounts. Because default accounts can often be used across multiple systems or applications, it can be difficult to monitor and audit the activities of these accounts. If default accounts continue to be used, these accounts may provide ongoing access permissions even if they are no longer needed. This increases unnecessary risks.

As a result, instead of using default accounts, it is a safer approach to create special and need-based accounts and protect these accounts with security measures as necessary. Access permissions of default accounts should be reviewed regularly and unnecessary ones should be disabled or deleted.

  
  

## Use of Authorized Groups

Other privileged group members such as Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins are very powerful. They can access the entire domain, all systems, all data, computers, laptops and similar resources.

It is recommended that ordinary user accounts not be in these authorized groups, the only exception should be the default domain admin account. What attackers are looking for is to access accounts belonging to domain administrators.

Microsoft recommends that you temporarily add the account to the Domain Admins group when Domain Admin access is required. Once the process is completed, the account should be removed from the Domain Admins group.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/3/image3-1.png)

  
  

## Using Multiple Accounts (Normal User and Administrator Account)

One of the cornerstones of computer security is distinguishing between a regular user account used for day-to-day tasks and a separate administrator account used for administrative tasks. This approach involves custom configuring and security measures for both accounts to suit their needs.

  

**Why Should We Use Multiple Accounts?**

**Separation of Privileges**

A regular user account has limited permissions while the administrator account has higher privileges. This prevents day-to-day business from interfering with administrative tasks.

  

**Limiting Attacks**

If daily tasks and administrative operations are done with the same account, malware or attackers can also access administrator privileges when they take over a regular user account.

  

**Data and System Security**

Using different accounts for different roles and using the administrator account only when necessary and on a private computer increases data and system security.

  

## How to use?

**Regular User Account**

A normal user account is used for routine activities such as daily tasks, internet browsing, and email checking. This account has limited permissions, reducing potential risks.

  

**Administrator Account**

This is an administrator account that is used only for special operations such as administrative tasks, system configuration, and software installation. This account has high privileges and it is important to keep it secure.

  

As a result, using multiple accounts for different roles increases computer security by ensuring separation of transactions. This approach minimizes risks and provides better protection against attacks. Note that the account used for administrative tasks should be kept particularly secure.

  
  

## Creating an Audit Policy

Audit policy settings are an important security measure used to monitor, control and record events on a network. These policies are used to increase the cybersecurity of an organization and detect unwanted activity. Enabling auditing policies through Group Policy is a critical step in detecting vulnerabilities and defending against cyber attacks.

Make sure that the Audit Policy settings mentioned below are configured in group policy and applied to all computers and servers.

For audit policy settings;

The “Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Advanced Audit Policy Configuration” section opens:

  
  

**Account Logon**

Ensure 'Audit Credential Validation' is set to 'Success and Failure'

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/3/image3-2.png)

  
  

Suspicious activities often start on end-user systems. You must monitor all systems constantly to be able to detect the security incidents immediately.

  
  

## Local Admin Account Management

Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) is a method that enables regular and automatic management of passwords of local admin accounts on workstations and servers. This solution provides a higher level of security against cyber attacks by constantly updating the passwords of local admin accounts.

  

## Why Should We Use Windows LAPS?

**Streamline Password Management**

Windows LAPS allows you to centrally manage passwords for all local admin accounts. This replaces manual password updates and hassle with an automatic and regular password rotation.

  

**Improving Password Security**

Automatic password changes and complex password policies increase password security. It reduces the risk of using old or weak passwords for a long time.

  

**Preventing Attacks**

Strong and regularly changing passwords for local admin accounts reduce the risk of malicious attackers taking over these accounts.

  

## Benefits and Best Practices

**Automatic Password Rotation**

Regular automatic change of local admin passwords.

  

**Strong Password Policies**

Use of strong passwords with complex password requirements and length limitations.

  

**Historical Password Records**

Storing old password records and preventing the use of past passwords.

  

**Password Logs**

Logging of password changes and updates.

  

In summary, Windows LAPS is an important security step that ensures safe and automatic management of local admin accounts. Thanks to password rotation, automatic updates and strong password policies, it increases resistance to cyber attacks, simplifies management and reduces workload.

  
  

## Creating a Password Policy

Creating a password policy in Active Directory is an important step to minimize security vulnerabilities and increase account security. A password policy contains rules and restrictions that determine how users' passwords are created, how complex they must be, and how long they must be changed.

  

## Why Should We Create a Password Policy?

**Require Strong Passwords**

The password policy allows users to use strong and hard-to-guess passwords. This makes accounts more resistant to malicious attacks.

  

**Increase Complexity**

Password policy enforces the use of complex passwords that contain different elements such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

  

**Regular Password Change**

The policy may require that passwords be changed periodically. This prevents the use of old or weak passwords.

  

**Active Directory Password Policy Creation Steps**

- Open Active Directory Administration Tools and select Group Policy Management.
- To Manage Passwords, go to Password Policies.
- Create a new password policy and name it.
- Specify the level of complexity you require in the password policy. For example, the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.
- Specify time period that the password will be valid. The password will then get disabled and the user will need an administrator help get it enabled back again. This ensures that the password is changed regularly.
- Specify the minimum number of times users must remember their previous passwords. This prevents old passwords from being reused.
- Set time limits or lockout of accounts as a result of attempts to enter incorrect passwords.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/3/image3-3.png)

  
  

As a result, creating a password policy is a critical step in improving Active Directory security and ensuring your accounts are more resilient to cyber attacks. Enforcing strong, complex passwords and regular password changes reduces risks while increasing security. By creating the right policies, you can enable users to manage their accounts more securely.

In this part of the training, we have covered the Active Directory, its importance, security, and the usage areas. We will keep learning about the " **Active Directory Security-2** " topic in the next chapter.

### Active Directory Security - 2

## Creating a Lockout Policy

Lockout policy is an important security measure that locks accounts and prevents access for a certain period of time as a result of specified number of incorrect password attempts. This policy is used to protect against cyber attacks and account security threats. Here are detailed explanations about the importance of the Lockout Policy:

  

**Protection Against Brute Force Attacks**

Brute force attacks are attempts by attackers to take over accounts by quickly and continuously trying different password combinations. The lockout policy protects against such attacks by ensuring that accounts are locked after a certain number of incorrect password attempts.

  

**Protection Against Pass-the-Hash Attacks**

Pass-the-hash attacks are attacks where attackers gain unauthorized access to accounts by obtaining password hashes. The lockout policy reduces the impact of such attacks because attackers face more difficult obstacles when there are a limited number of attempts.

  

**Increase Account Security**

Lockout policy increases account security because if account owners forget or lose their passwords, the possibility of third parties hijacking the accounts by making endless password attempts is reduced.

  

**Account Awareness**

If it is noticed that accounts are constantly locked or blocked, it raises awareness that this may be a sign of a potential attack or security breach. In this way, security threats can be detected at an early stage.

  

**Slowing Down Attackers:**

The lockout policy slows down attackers' attempts to quickly take over accounts. To have the accounts locked after a certain number of attempts by using the proper measures is an effective way that avoid attackers easily take control of the systems.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/4/image3-4.png)

  
  

In conclusion, creating a Lockout Policy is an important step in increasing account security and protecting against cyber attacks. A properly configured lockout policy strengthens your security while protecting users' accounts.

  

## Secure Admin Workstation (SAW)

Secure Admin Workstation (SAW), is a specialized computer system used only to perform administrative tasks with privileged accounts. This approach is an effective way to increase cybersecurity and minimize potential threats. SAW ensures that administrator operations are secured and is an important step towards maximizing security.

  

## The Importance of Secure Admin Workstation

The use of Secure Admin Station is of great importance for the following reasons:

  

**Isolated Environment for Privileged Operations**

SAW provides an isolated environment where privileged accounts will be used only to perform administrative tasks. This ensures that transactions and systems are secured even if attackers take over accounts.

  

**Access Control**

SAW can be secured as it is used only for administrative operations. This makes it difficult for malware or attackers to access the system during ordinary user operations.

  

**Reducing Cyber Threats**

Using SAW reduces the risk of downloading malware, getting infected with ransomware or malicious links.

  

## Secure Admin Workstation Features

The Secure Admin Station must have the following features:

  

**Isolated Environment**

SAW should be isolated from normal user operations and network traffic.

  

**No Internet Access**

SAW should not be used for tasks such as checking email or web browsing. Internet access should be blocked.

  

**Strong Authentication**

Access to SAW should only be possible with privileged accounts, and these accounts should be protected with strong passwords or multi-factor authentication.

  

**Only Required Applications Should Be Installed**

Only applications required for administrative operations should be installed in SAW. Unnecessary software and applications should be removed.

  

**Keeping Up-to-Date**

The operating system and applications in SAW should be updated regularly. Security updates and patches should be applied regularly.

  

## Advantages of Secure Admin Workstation

Advantages of using Secure Admin Workstation for the organization:

  

**Better Security**

SAW increases cybersecurity by performing privileged operations in an isolated environment.

  

**Reduced Threat Risk**

The risk of malicious software or attacks reaching organizational systems is reduced.

  

**Control of Administrator Operations**

SAW allows you to centrally control administrator operations, which is advantageous in terms of authorization and access monitoring.

  

**Rapid Response**

Since only administrative operations are performed in SAW, any security incident can be quickly detected and responded to.

  

The use of SAW offers an effective way to increase cybersecurity and reduce potential risks. Performing privileged transactions in an isolated environment helps you create a stronger defense against cyber attacks. Organizations should consider the use of secure executive station as a serious security measure.

  

## Operating System Support

With each new Windows operating system release, Microsoft introduces built-in security features and improvements. More importantly, you get security updates. Operating systems that have come to end of life whose security updates are not provided by the manufacturers anymore are one of the biggest risks to organizational security.

Just using the latest operating system version will increase overall security.

For example, New Security Features in Windows Server 2022:

- Secured-core Server
- Hardware root of trust
- Firmware protection
- UEFI secure boot
- Virtualization based security

  

## Management of Service Accounts

In the Active Directory (AD) environment, service accounts are accounts used to ensure the proper functioning of systems, applications and services. However, these accounts are security sensitive and can cause cybersecurity risks if not managed properly. These accounts can often have high privileges and lead to security weaknesses such as prolonged use of passwords or access rights.

How service accounts should be managed from a security perspective:

  

- A separate account should be used for each service or application. This ensures isolation and protects the security of other accounts when one account is affected. Using a shared service account may increase security risk.
- Giving service accounts only the minimum privileges they need prevents attackers from taking advantage of their access rights. Each service account should only have access to the resources and functions it requires.
- Passwords for service accounts should be changed regularly and comply with strong password policies. Passwords should not always remain the same. Automation tools and managed service accounts can be used for password management.
- Service accounts should only be given access to the systems and resources they need. Network access should not be expanded unnecessarily. Unnecessary network traffic should be blocked.
- The activities of service accounts should be regularly monitored and audited. Abnormal activities must be detected and responded to quickly. Access records should be reviewed regularly.
- Systems and applications containing service accounts must be kept up to date and patched. Regular updates should be made to avoid being vulnerable to security vulnerabilities.

  

Service accounts management stands out as a key element of Active Directory security. When properly managed, service accounts can increase system security and provide a more effective defense against cyber attacks.

  

## Important User and Group Changes

In Active Directory security, effective tracking of important user and group changes is critical to ensuring network security and data integrity. Monitoring these changes is necessary to detect unauthorized access attempts, prevent security breaches, and meet compliance requirements.

Event logs of Active Directory servers are used to track these changes. Transactions such as account creation, deletion, password changes, and group memberships are recorded in these logs. However, in large-scale networks, manually monitoring these event logs can be difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, using automation and monitoring tools can be an effective solution. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems collect and analyze these events at a central point, identify abnormal activities and send alerts to the security team.

Below are the basic events that need to be followed regarding users and groups.

  

**User Activities Table**

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/4/win-table-1.png)

  
  

**Group Activities Table**

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/4/win-table-2.png)

  
  

## Local Admin Group Membership Control

A user with local admin rights has full access to the entire Windows Operating System and has the ability to download and install software which may include malicious software as well, enable/disable accounts, disable security feature of the system, access user information and steal credentials or data which may lead to various security issues.

A standard user must not be in the local admin group.

The Microsoft security vulnerabilities report states:

“Of all the Windows vulnerabilities discovered in 2018, 169 of these were considered 'critical'. Removing admin rights could have mitigated 85% of these critical vulnerabilities”

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/4/image3-5.png)

  
  

By removing users from the local admin group, you greatly reduce the risks of attackers to gain access to your computer and network.

  

It is recommended to use group policy to control the local admin group. If you remove these permissions from the local computer without central control, these rights can be added again.

  

## Conclusion/Summary

Active Directory is one of the cornerstones of an organization's IT infrastructure, but its security is also critically important. Without proper configuration and monitoring, malicious users or attackers can infiltrate your network, gain access to sensitive data, or cause service disruptions. Therefore, it is critical to take measures such as strong password policies, regular account monitoring, and restriction of unnecessary access rights. In addition, regular application of security patches, installation of firewalls, and use of appropriate authentication methods are also necessary to improve Active Directory security.

We will learn about the “ **Windows DNS Security”** topic in the next part of our training.

### Windows DNS Security

The security of the Domain Name System (DNS) service is extremely important for the overall security of a network. It facilitates the communication of users and systems on the network. However, this important service can also be the target of malicious attackers, so the security of this service is extremely important.

DNS translates these names into corresponding IP addresses when a URL is entered in a web browser, or when an application connects to a web service or wants to resolve a domain. However, if the DNS service is not secure, attackers can manipulate DNS queries and redirect users to fake or malicious sites. This type of attack is often called DNS poisoning or DNS spoofing and can be used to steal users' personal information or sensitive information (password, credit card, etc.). Additionally, a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on the DNS service can cause a complete collapse of a network or web service.

The security of the DNS service ensures that the exchange of information on the network remains secure and private. This not only protects users' personal information but also protects businesses' sensitive information and services from malicious attackers. Therefore, the security of the DNS service is vital to the overall security of a network.

Windows DNS Server is a DNS service provided by Microsoft and is typically used by Windows-based networks. This service is widely preferred, especially in Windows environments, as it is tightly integrated with the Windows Active Directory service. However, the security of Windows DNS Server is a critical issue due to the fact that attackers can target this service and compromise the network.

This highlights that the security of Windows DNS Server is an integral part of the overall security of a network. Therefore, these service protection strategies and practices should be understood and implemented by network administrators and security professionals. Continual evaluation and improvement of Windows DNS Server security is necessary to protect against DNS attacks, ensure proper routing of network traffic, and maintain overall network security. Here are the main issues related to Windows DNS Server security.

  

## DNS Zone Transfer Restriction

DNS Zone transfer is the process of copying all DNS records from the primary DNS server (master) to the secondary DNS servers (slave or backup). This process is often used for DNS backup and load balancing.

DNS data is usually organized in a structure called a "zone", which contains all the records of a particular DNS namespace (domain). A DNS zone transfer copies all the data of a zone from one server to another. This usually happens when changes are made to the primary server and those changes need to be pushed to all backup servers.

Zone transfers can be of two types:

  

**Full Zone Transfer (AXFR)**

This copies all the information of a zone from the primary DNS server to the backup DNS server. Such transfers usually occur when a zone is created for the first time or when the backup server is completely rebooted.

  

**Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR)**

This only copies changes in a zone from the primary DNS server to the backup DNS server. When a zone changes, the backup server only receives the changes, increasing efficiency and reducing network traffic.

Zone transfers usually occur automatically, but a network administrator can trigger them manually. The security of zone transfers is important because if an attacker gains access to a zone transfer, they can learn about all the records in the DNS server. For this reason, we usually restrict zone transfers to only allow reliable backup servers.

You can follow the steps below to restrict DNS Zone transfers in Windows Server 2019:

Open the DNS management console. To do this, open "Server Manager", then select the "Tools" menu and click "DNS". On the screen that opens, right-click on the relevant zone and click on “Properties”.

On the screen that opens, switch to the “Zone Transfers” tab and select the “Allow zone transfers:” option and select the “Only to the following servers” option to allow only certain IP addresses. Then write the list of IP addresses to be allowed by saying “Edit”. (As seen in the screenshot below, the IP address 172.16.8.1 is allowed to make zone transfer.)

## DNSSec

DNSSEC or Domain Name System Security Extensions is a set of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards used to verify the integrity and authenticity of DNS queries and responses. Simply put, DNSSEC helps verify that the results of a DNS query have not been manipulated or altered.

DNSSEC actually determines whether a DNS response is genuine and has been modified. It does this by digitally signing DNS responses and using that digital signature in the response to every DNS query.

To set DNSSEC, you can follow the steps below in Windows Server 2019:

Open the DNS management console. To do this, open the "Server Manager", then select the "Tools" menu and click on the "DNS" option. Right-click on the zone you will apply and click “DNSSEC” -> “Sign the Zone”.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/5/image4-5.png)

  
  

  

A special signature etc. if it will not be used, select the “Use default settings to sign the zone” option and click the “Next” button.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/5/image4-6.png)

  
  

  

DNSSec settings defined as default are shown briefly. You can complete the DNSSec setting by clicking “Next” and then “Finish”.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/5/image4-7.png)

  
  

DNSSEC has cons and pros. For example, DNSSEC can be complex to implement and manage and use more system resources. Therefore, a DNSSEC implementation must be carefully planned and managed.

  

## DNS Server Monitoring

Monitoring DNS server activity can help identify a number of potential threats and attacks. These activities are located in Microsoft -> Windows -> DNSServer\Audit on Windows Eventlog. Some important events included here are:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/5/img3.png)

  
  

DNS server activities must be monitored constantly which will avoid “ **DNS Hijacking** ” attacks by early detecting them. DNS Hijacking is a type of attack made by directing DNS queries to different DNS servers and changing the response as desired. This can be done by changing the DNS records on the DNS Server.

  

## Additional Information

**Updates**

It is very important to regularly update associated software such as update, Windows DNS service and operating system. Updates usually fix security vulnerabilities and protect the service against new threats.

  

**Access Limitation**

Access to the DNS service should be provided to users and services as needed. A policy of limiting high-privilege accounts and keeping authorization to a minimum can help mitigate potential harm.

  

**Training**

IT personnel and users are required to be aware of threats to DNS security and receive training in secure practices.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the Windows DNS security topic, and we will be learning about “ **Windows DHCP Security”** in the next chapter of our training.

### Windows DHCP Security

The security of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service is extremely important for the overall security of a network. It facilitates the communication of users and systems on the network. However, this important service can also be the target of malicious attackers, so the security of this service is extremely important.

DHCP ensures that devices connected to the network are automatically assigned IP addresses. This makes it easier to manage large networks without having network administrators manually set IP addresses for each device. However, if the DHCP service is not secure, an attacker can add his or her own DHCP server to the network and thus provide misleading network configuration information to devices connecting to the network. This allows the attackers to redirect traffic to their system and steal potentially sensitive information.

The security of this service ensures that information exchange on the network remains safe and private. This not only protects users' personal information but also protects businesses' sensitive information and services from malicious attackers. Therefore, the security of the DHCP service is vital to the overall security of a network.

DHCP, one of the indispensable elements of networks, prevents network administrators from manually assigning IP addresses to each device by automatically assigning IP addresses to devices on the network. However, the security of this important service is often overlooked. Windows DHCP server security is critical to the overall security of the network. To prevent potential threats such as unintended network access, denial of service (DoS) attacks, or data leaks, it is essential to secure the Windows DHCP server.

Due to the way DHCP works, there are various security vulnerabilities. For example, the DHCP service will usually assign an IP address to any device on the network. This means that an unauthorized device can connect to the network and perform potentially harmful activities. Additionally, DHCP-based attacks can knock out the DHCP service or spoof network traffic. Finally, the confidentiality and integrity of DHCP data must be protected against the possibility of misleading or malicious alteration of IP address information.

  
  

## MAC Filtering

MAC Filtering can be implemented via Media Access Control (MAC) addresses using DHCP on Windows Server. It is used to control whether devices with a specific MAC address receive an IP address or not.

MAC address filtering is used when you want only certain devices on your network to obtain an IP address, or when you want to prevent certain devices from obtaining an IP address. This can improve your network security because it only allows certain devices to access your network.

You can follow the steps below to perform DHCP MAC address filtering on Windows Server:

After opening "Server Manager", select "DHCP" from the "Tools" menu. On the DHCP Management screen that opens, from the “IPv4” -> “Filter” section, right-click on the “Allow” or “Deny” section and select “New Filter”.

The "Allow" option in the filter type only gives IP addresses to certain MAC addresses, while the "Deny" option prevents certain MAC addresses from obtaining IP addresses.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/6/image4-8.png)

  
  

In the "New Filter" window, enter the MAC address you want to filter in the "MAC Address" field and click the "Add" button. This way MAC address filtering is enabled.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/6/image4-9.png)

  
  

MAC filtering can be an effective way to increase network security, but it is not a sufficient security measure on its own because MAC addresses can easily be spoofed. That's why it should often be used in conjunction with other security measures.

  

## Rogue DHCP Blocking

Rogue DHCP is when an unauthorized and unexpected DHCP server starts serving on a network, often for malicious purposes. A Rogue DHCP server can provide clients with misleading network configuration information, which can redirect network traffic to unwanted destinations or even redirect users to malicious websites.

To detect the Rogue DHCP server on Windows Server, the DHCP server authorization mechanism that Microsoft designed to automatically monitor DHCP servers and detect unauthorized servers is used.

DHCP server authorization verifies that a DHCP server is registered and authorized in Active Directory. If a DHCP server is not authorized, the DHCP service is automatically stopped and that server cannot distribute IP addresses.

To use DHCP server authorization, the DHCP server must be in an Active Directory domain. To authorize the DHCP server, open the DHCP console, right-click the DHCP server and click "Authorize"

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Windows-System-Security/6/image4-10.png)

  
  

Monitor DHCP servers regularly and if you detect an unauthorized DHCP server running on your network, deauthorize or remove it immediately.

By default, you can see DHCP logs under the "C:\Windows\system32\dhcp" directory and follow them from there. For Rogue DHCP detection, critical logs with id 50 and above should be especially monitored.

The meanings of some DHCP Event IDs are as follows. 50+ Event ID is important for Rogue Server detection.

## Conclusion

The security of the Windows DHCP service is a critical issue that the network administrators must constantly consider and work on. Network administrators should always be proactive in understanding new threats and risks, adopting new security technologies and best practices, and continually improving the security of their network. Your network security is ultimately part of the overall security and success of your business.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the importance of Windows DHCP security, MAC filtering and Rogue DHCP blocking topics.
