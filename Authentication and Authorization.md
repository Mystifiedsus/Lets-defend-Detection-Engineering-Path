### What is Authentication and What are Authentication Methods?

Authentication and authorization are two basic concepts that have vital importance in terms of information security. Authentication is the process of proving the authenticity of a user's declared identity. The user usually provides credentials such as username and password, and the system verifies this information. This process allows the user to prove their identity in the system and verify that they are a real user. Authorization is a process that takes place after authentication. In this process, the user is granted or denied access to certain resources (files, databases, network resources, etc.). Authorization is accomplished by specifying the user's access rights, assigning roles, and setting permissions as needed. In this way, users can only access the resources they need and unauthorized access is prevented.

Authentication and authorization play an important role in ensuring the security of information systems. Incorrect authentication or weak authorization methods can allow unauthorized users to log into systems and access sensitive data. This puts information security at risk. Therefore, reliable and strong authentication and authorization mechanisms should be used and regularly updated.

  

## What is Authentication and What are Authentication Methods?

Authentication is the process of proving the authenticity of a user's declared identity. In this process, the user provides credentials (username, password, biometric data, etc.) and the system verifies this information. Authentication is performed when the user is logging into the system or accessing certain resources.

The methods used for authentication can vary. Commonly used authentication methods are:

**Password Based Authentication**

The user provides the username-password combination. This information is verified when logging into the system. The password should be strong, changed regularly, and stored securely by users.

  

**Multi-Factor Authentication**

It is a method in which more than one validation factor is used. For example, a user name and password may be required, as well as an SMS verification code or a one-time use code generated through an authentication app. This method provides an additional layer of security.

  

**Biometric Authentication**

It authenticates using the physical or behavioral characteristics of the user. Biometric data such as fingerprint, face recognition, voice recognition, retina scan can be used. This method provides a more secure authentication.

  
  

**One-Time Passwords**

Users are provided with one-time passwords that are valid for a certain period of time. These passwords are usually transmitted to the user via SMS, email or authentication applications. A new password is required for each session.

  

**Certificate Based Authentication**

Users authenticate using a digital certificate. These certificates are usually provided by a trusted third party and contain a key pair that authenticates the user.

These methods are used to authenticate users and provide secure access to systems. The method to be chosen is determined by the user's needs, the application's requirements and security policies.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered what the authentication and the authorization is, and commonly used authentication methods. In the next part of the training, we will learn about the “ **Authorization and its Methods** ” topic.

### Authentication and Authorization Methods

Authorization is the process of granting or denying a user access to certain resources (files, databases, network resources, etc.). Authorization, which is performed after the authentication process, allows the users to determine the level of access to certain resources.

Authorization methods can be implemented in a variety of ways. Commonly used authorization approaches are:

  

**Role-Based Authorization**

In this method, users are associated with specific roles, and each role has specific privileges. Users gain access to certain resources in the system depending on their role. For example, users with an "Administrator" role can access all functions of the system, while users with a "User" role may be subject to certain restrictions.

  

**Policy-Based Authorization**

In this method, authorization decisions are based on certain principles (rules). Policy-based authorization includes policy rules that determine users' access rights. For example, a policy rule may specify whether a particular user can access or not access a particular resource in a particular time zone.

  

**Permission-Based Authorization**

In this method, permissions are defined separately for each resource or each process. Users are given permissions to access certain resources or perform certain actions. For example, a user is given specific permissions to read, write, or delete a file.

Authorization methods can be preferred according to different scenarios and system requirements. In some cases, a combination of more than one approach may be used. The authorization process effectively implements security policies and provides users with the right level of access.

### Authentication and Authorization Processes

Authentication and authorization processes are critical to information security. Here are the basic steps of these processes:

  

## Authentication Process

**User Identification:** A username or a user ID is usually used to identify the user.

**Providing Credentials:** The user provides their credentials. This information is usually a combination of username and password.

**Authentication of Credentials:** The system verifies the credentials provided by the user. Password authentication, biometric data comparison, or other authentication methods can be used.

(Image Source: [https://swoopnow.com/user-authentication/](https://swoopnow.com/user-authentication/) )

  
  

## Session Management

  

**Login Request:** When authentication is successful, the user makes a login request.

**Login Process:** The system assigns a session ID to the user and associates this with the session.

**Storage of Session ID:** The user's session ID is usually stored with a cookie or session ID mechanism.

  

## Authorization Process

**Requesting Access to Resources:** The user requests access to certain resources (files, databases, network resources, etc.).

**Authorization Decision:** The system evaluates the user's right to access the requested resource and makes an authorization decision.

**Access Permissions:** The user is granted or denied access to the requested resource. These permissions are determined by the user's role or authorization policies.

  

## Session Termination

**Session Termination Request:** The user requests a logout or the session expires automatically.

**Session Termination Process:** The system terminates the user's session and releases session-related resources.

**Deletion of Session ID:** The user's session ID and related information are deleted from the system.

  

These processes allow the user to authenticate, log in, authorize access requests to certain resources, and log out securely. The correct and safe implementation of these processes is important to ensure the security of information systems and data confidentiality.

  

In this part of the training, the authentication process, session management, authorization process and logout terms are discussed. In the next part of the training, We will be learning about the “ **Authentication and Authorization Applications** ” topic.

Authentication and Authorization Applications
Authentication and Authorization applications are used in many different fields and industries. Some commonly used Authentication and Authorization practices are:

NOTE : These are just some examples and the Authentication and Authorization applications apply to many different systems and applications. Each application has its own authentication and authorization requirements, determined by security policies and user needs.



Operating Systems: Authentication is required for users to log into an operating system. Users are authenticated using a password, biometric data, or other authentication methods. Authorization, on the other hand, determines users' access rights to certain resources.



Web Applications: The authentication process is used for users to access web applications. Users are authenticated with authentication methods such as username and password combination, social media accounts, or one-time passwords. Authorization determines users' permissions to access certain pages or functions.



Cloud Services: Authentication and authorization practices are also important in cloud-based services. Users authenticate access to cloud services and access certain resources or data with authorization.



Mobile Apps: Mobile apps may require users to authenticate. Users are authenticated using authentication methods such as username and password, fingerprint scanners or facial recognition. Authorization determines users' access rights to different features of the application or data.



Database Access: Databases require authentication and authorization processes of users. Database users authenticate with database access permissions and set access rights to specific data.



Each of these applications uses Authentication and Authorization processes to authenticate users and determine their access rights to certain resources. These processes are important in terms of data security, user privacy and system security.


In this part of the training, authentication and authorization applications are discussed. The next part of the training will cover the “ Authentication and Authorization Security Tips” topic.

Authentication and Authorization Security Tips
Authentication and Authorization processes are critical to ensure the security of the system. Here are some security tips you should consider in the Authentication and Authorization processes:


Use Strong Passwords

It is important to choose strong and complex passwords when setting up users' passwords. Passwords must contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters and should be changed regularly.


Use Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication methods provide an additional layer of security. In addition to the username and password, it requires a second authentication factor such as an SMS verification code, mobile app, or a physical security device.


Define User Roles and Authorization Levels Accurately

Users' roles and authorization levels determine their access rights to resources in the system. Roles and authorization levels should be accurately defined in accordance with needs and tasks.

Implement Secure Session Management

Session management processes must securely handle users' login, logon, and logoff. It is important that sessions are automatically terminated after a certain period of time or that sessions are terminated automatically aftera prolonged inactivity.


Use Secure Session IDs and Storage Methods

It is important to store and transmit the session IDs securely. Cookies should be secured, encryption of session IDs or use of secure session management mechanisms should be preferred.


Enforce Authorization Controls

It is important to properly control users' access rights and authorizations. Users should only be granted access to the resources and functions they need. In addition, appropriate authorization processes and control mechanisms should be established for authorization changes or updates.


Perform Security Checks

Security audits should be conducted regularly to verify that the Authentication and Authorization processes are working properly and complying with security requirements. This is important for detecting and resolving security vulnerabilities.


Keep Up-to-Date

It is important to keep the authentication and authorization processes up to date. The authentication methods and authorization protocols used must be constantly updated against security vulnerabilities. Security patches and updates should be applied regularly.


These security tips can be applied to improve the security of the Authentication and Authorization processes. Because each application and system may have different requirements, it is important to develop customized solutions and controls in accordance with security policies and standards.


In this part of the training, we have covered security tips that can be applied in authentication and authorization processes. In the next part of the training, We will be learning about the “ Authentication and Authorization Related Technologies and Standards ” topic.

### Sample Scenarios and Application Reviews

Here are some use case scenarios and application reviews for the Authentication and Authorization topic:

  

**On-premises Authentication and Authorization Scenario**

This scenario deals with the authentication and authorization processes of users who want to access a company's internal network. Users connect to the company's central authentication server (LDAP) with their username and password, and are granted access rights to certain resources after they are authenticated. A sample application review might include authentication and authorization processes in an environment using Microsoft Active Directory.

  

**Two-Factor Authentication Application**

In this scenario, two-factor authentication is implemented to increase the security of users of a web-based application. Users log in with their username and password, while also using a second verification factor such as a mobile app or SMS verification code. A sample app review can show how two-factor authentication applications like "Google Authenticator" or "Microsoft Authenticator" are integrated.

  

**API Authentication and Authorization Scenario**

This scenario deals with the authentication and authorization processes of an API. API users authenticate with API keys or access tokens, and authorization checks are performed using these credentials. A sample application review might include authentication and authorization processes for an API using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

  

**SSO (Single Sign-On) Application**

In this scenario, we will be handling the situation where an organization wants to access multiple applications with a single authentication. Once users authenticate, they automatically gain access to other applications. A sample application review can demonstrate how to implement an SSO solution integrated with Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

  

#### Conclusion

In the Authentication and Authorization training, we have learned the authentication and authorization processes, the methods used in these processes, and related technologies and standards. We now know that authentication is the process of verifying an individual's claimed identity, often through username and password combination, biometric data, or multi-factor methods. We have seen that authorization is a process that determines a user’s access ability and what operations he/she can perform and what data he/she can access on a particular system. We have found out that hese processes interact together and are often inseparable. Finally, we discussed the various technologies and standards that support and secure these processes. These include authentication and authorization protocols such as OAuth, SAML and LDAP.
