### SIEM and Rule/Correlation

Fighting against today's sophisticated cyber threats requires organizations to continually strengthen their security measures. Therefore, security teams are looking for an effective approach to monitor their networks and systems, detect and respond to potential threats. This is where SIEM systems and the rule/correlation relationship come into play. The real power of SIEM comes from the rules and correlation capabilities used when analyzing this data.

The basic rules that the SIEM system uses to detect certain events or situations are called rules. For example, a rule might be triggered if a particular user has multiple failed login attempts, or if there is an unexpected increase in traffic on a particular port. However, complex and advanced threats often occur not in a single event, but as a result of multiple events simultaneously occurring. Here's where correlation plays a role.

Correlation enables the detection of a potential threat by cross-analysis of different events and data points. Specifically, it is used to describe a possible threat that may arise from a series of events occurring together. For example, a combination of events, such as a user making many unsuccessful login attempts, or trying to pull sensitive data from another device, can trigger a correlation rule. This goes beyond isolated incidents and helps detect more complex threats.

SIEM and the rule/correlation relationship enhance organizations' ability to defend against cyber threats by enabling them to detect and respond to security incidents more quickly and effectively.

  

## Rules-Based Threat Detection

Rule-based threat detection is a security approach that involves defining specific rules and patterns within a security system and identifying events or activities that conform to these rules.

Rule-based threat detection relies on a specific set of rules when monitoring events and activities occurring within an organization's security infrastructure. These rules are used to assess compliance with the organization's security policies, recognize potential threats, and detect specific security events or patterns.

Rules used for rule-based threat detection represent a combination of one or more conditions. Each rule contains a condition or pattern that describes a particular event or activity. An example rule might be: "If a user enters an incorrect password three times consecutively, generate a security alert."

Rules-based threat detection begins with applying rules to events or activities collected from data sources. If an event or activity contains a condition that complies with one or more rules, that rule is triggered. Triggering the rule may lead to the generation of a security alert or the execution of a specific action.

Rule-based threat detection is used in many security areas such as network, application, data, and system security. For example, network traffic monitoring and rule-based threat detection are commonly used to detect malicious network traffic and unwanted activities.

Rule-based threat detection provides effective defense against specific and known threats. However, this method also has disadvantages including potential limitations in detecting unknown or advanced threats and the possibility of generating false positive alarms.

For up-to-date and effective rule-based threat detection, rules need to be reviewed and updated regularly. Current rules must adapt to both the security needs of the organization and the evolving threat landscape.

Rule-based threat detection is a powerful tool for monitoring security incidents in organizations and automatically detecting events that comply with certain rules. However, because of its limitations, organizations often combine rule-based detection with other advanced security approaches and threat intelligence.

  

## Correlation-Based Threat Detection

Correlation-based threat detection monitors an organization's network security and detects threats by analyzing security events and data. This approach goes beyond isolated events and involves evaluating multiple events and data points together.

Correlation refers to the process of identifying meaningful relationships between events and data. In particular, it aims to detect a possible threat as a result of the combination of many separate events or activities. This approach typically includes data from different sources, such as network traffic, system logs, user behavior, and threat intelligence.

Scenarios that use correlation include detecting abnormal activities on the network, monitoring malware attacks, detecting data leaks, and detecting advanced threats. For instance, you can use correlation to identify multiple users attempting to access sensitive data simultaneously or to recognize a certain malware showing similar behavior on different systems.

Correlation-based threat detection is implemented using specialized correlation engines or security solutions such as SIEM systems. Correlation engines analyze data using specific rules and algorithms and try to identify potential threats. Correlation engines can be customized to lower false alarm rates and identify genuine risks.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Threat Detection with Correlation:

  

**Advantages:**

- Ability to detect advanced threats.
- Understanding relationships between data points.
- High customization ability.

  

  

**Disadvantages:**

- It can be complicated and time-consuming.
- It May lead to False Positive results (risk of missing real threats).

  

  

Correlation-based threat detection helps organizations develop a more effective defense strategy against more complex and advanced cyber threats. This method allows organizations to be better prepared against potential threats by conducting a more thorough analysis of security incidents.

In this part of the training, we have discussed what correlation is, its significance, its relationship with SIEM, and rule/correlation-based threat detection. In the next part of the training, the subject “ **Basic Components of the Correlation Rule** ” will be explained.

### Basic Components of the Correlation Rule

While the core components of the correlation rule aim to detect complex cyber threats, it includes several important components for this purpose. First, Events and Source of Data form the basis of these components. Security events and data are collected from the organization's networks and systems. These sources include security infrastructure such as network logs, system event logs, application logs, and security devices.

  

The second important component of the correlation rule is the Fundamental Principle of the Correlation Rule. This principle defines the conditions under which a correlation rule is triggered when certain conditions or events occur. The correlation rule helps the organization be better prepared against security threats by analyzing meaningful relationships between security events and data.

  

Another critical component of the correlation rule is the Conditions and Match conditions. This component contains the conditions and match conditions required to create and trigger the rule. For example, a specific security event or activity can trigger the rule if certain conditions or requirements are met. These conditions are determined in accordance with the organization's security policies and threat model.

  

Finally, one of the components that makes the correlation rule work is triggering the rule. This means that when events and data are analyzed, the rule detects that a particular situation has occurred. A triggered rule signals the presence of a specific security event or threat and initiates an appropriate response. This component enables the organization to respond to security threats quickly and effectively.

  

## Source of Events and Data

A key component of the correlation rule involves the sources of security events and data. This component plays a critical role in setting up the correlation rule and ensuring it works effectively.

  

**Security Events and Data**

The main elements used when creating the correlation rule are security events and data that come from the organization's security infrastructure. These may include network logs, system event logs, application logs, data generated by security devices, and threat intelligence.

  

  

**Source of Incidents**

The source of security incidents is the organization's network and systems. For instance, network logs may contain information about traffic and connections on the network while system logs capture events related to the operating system and applications.

  

  

**Source of Data**

The source of the data used when creating the correlation rule is also crucial. These resources come from security infrastructure components such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), antivirus software, and SIEM systems.

  

  

**Data Types**

The data types used when creating a correlation rule can vary. For example, IP addresses, user IDs, port numbers, timestamps, file names, and more may be examples of these data types.

  

  

**Threat Intelligence**

Threat intelligence can also be used to increase the effectiveness of the correlation rule by providing information about new threats and malicious activities that the organization needs to know. This is important for updating correlation rules and being better prepared for new threats.

  

  

**Collecting and Storing Data**

Collecting and storing this data is a critical step for analyzing security incidents and applying correlation rules. Organizations often store this data using log management and storage systems.

  

  

The source of events and data is a fundamental building block for the correlation rule to work effectively. Accurately identifying these resources increases the ability to detect security incidents and provides organizations with greater visibility. When creating the correlation rule, we should consider which data sources will be used and what type of data will be analyzed in accordance with the security needs of the organization.

  

## Basic Principle of Correlation Rule

The basic principle of the correlation rule describes how the rule works to detect a specific security threat or event by analyzing security events and data. This principle helps organizations monitor and respond to cyber threats more effectively.

  

More on the basic principle of the correlation rule:

  

  

**Correlation of Security Events**

The main purpose of the correlation rule is to identify relationships between security events and data. These relationships are created according to the organization's security policies and threat model. Specifically, it identifies scenarios where certain security events or activities combine to create a threat.

  

  

**Timestamp of Events**

A part of the basic principle of the correlation rule involves timestamping events. This identifies situations where the order and timing of events are important. For example, events such as a user repeatedly entering an incorrect password and then attempting to access a sensitive data file may require a specific sequence and timing.

  

  

**Triggering the Correlation Rule**

As a result of the basic principle, the correlation rule is triggered when it detects a combination of certain conditions or events. This provides the security team with an opportunity to identify potential threats or anomalies. It is particularly used for detecting complex threat scenarios.

  

  

**Appropriate Response**

Triggering the correlation rule leads the organization to provide an appropriate response. This response can take various forms, such as alerts, notifications, or automated responses to the security team. Thanks to the correlation rule, threats can be responded to more quickly and effectively.

  

  

**Customization and Improvement**

The basic principle of the correlation rule can be customized and improved to suit organizations' security policies and requirements. This allows organizations to become more susceptible to security threats.

  

  

The fundamental principle of the correlation rule provides a basic guide for organizations to strengthen their security operations and help them detect more complex threats. Thanks to this principle, organizations can better understand security incidents and respond more effectively.

  

## Conditions and Matching Conditions

One of the key components of the correlation rule is defining the conditions and match conditions necessary for the rule to be triggered. This component is an important element that directs the operation of the correlation rule and links security events or situations to specific characteristics. Here are more detailed descriptions of these components:

  

  

**Definition of Conditions**

A correlation rule contains conditions that define a particular security event or condition. Each condition is determined in accordance with the organization's security objectives and threat model. For example, a condition might be "A certain user accidentally deleting a file more than once."

  

  

**Matching Conditions**

The circumstances in which certain conditions or events come together for the correlation rule to work are called matching conditions. These conditions determine when the rule will be triggered. For example, a match condition can be defined as "If Condition 1 AND Condition 2 AND Condition 3 match, trigger the rule.”

  

  

**Binding Operators**

Binding operators are used to combine matching conditions and create complex correlation rules. The most common binding operators are "AND" and "OR" operators. The "AND" operator means that all conditions must match at the same time, while the "OR" operator means that at least one condition must match.

  

  

**Priority and Ordering**

Organizations often have more than one correlation rule. The priority level of each rule is set to determine the situations in which that rule is primarily applied. This determines which rule takes precedence and is applied in cases where multiple rules are triggered at the same time.

  

  

**Customization and Improvement**

The conditions and matching conditions of the correlation rule can be customized, regularly reviewed, and improved to fit the security needs of the organization. This is important to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the correlation rule.

  

  

Conditions and matching conditions are the basic building blocks of the correlation rule. Correctly identifying these components increases organizations' ability to detect specific threat scenarios and reduces false alarms. When making a correlation rule, we should plan the selection of conditions and matching conditions carefully, considering the organization's security policies, threat intelligence, and security objectives.

  

## Triggering the Correlation Rule

One of the key components of the correlation rule involves the mechanism by which the rule is triggered when certain conditions or events come together. This helps organizations detect and respond to cyber threats more effectively. Here's more information on how the correlation rule is triggered:

  

  

**Match of Conditions**

Triggering of the correlation rule occurs when the conditions of the rule or match conditions are met. This means that during the analysis of security events and data, the rule detects a specific threat or anomaly. For example, events such as a specific user entering an incorrect password into a system and then attempting to access sensitive data may meet the conditions of the rule.

  

  

**Event Timestamp**

Triggering the correlation rule also includes situations where the order and timing of events are important. Specifically, it describes scenarios where events must follow a specific order and timing. This allows organizations to analyze sequential events or events that occur over a period of time.

  

  

**Analysis of Events**

Triggering the correlation rule involves in-depth analysis of events and data. The rule aggregates security events and evaluates whether these events comply with the organization's security policies, threat model, and customized rule conditions.

  

  

**Response Trigger**

A triggered correlation rule allows the organization to initiate an appropriate response. This response can be in the form of alerts, notifications, or automated responses to the security team. In particular, it helps the organization quickly respond to potential threats.

  

  

**Trigger Priority**

Organizations often have more than one correlation rule. The triggering priority of the correlation rule is defined in a certain order. This determines which rule will be applied first in cases where more than one rule is triggered at the same time.

  

  

The triggering mechanism of the correlation rule is an important component that helps organizations detect and respond to security threats more quickly and effectively. When creating the correlation rule, the conditions and trigger mechanism to be used should be carefully planned, taking into account the specific threat scenarios and security policies of the organizations.

  

In this part of the training, some issues about the basic components of the correlation rule are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the topic “ **Creating Rules/Correlation** ” will be explained.

### Creating Rules/Correlation

SIEM collects security events and data in a central location and helps detect potential threats by analyzing this data. Rules and correlations are the key components that make SIEM work effectively. Creating rules and correlations increases the SIEM's capacity to detect and respond to security incidents using its powerful analytics capabilities. These processes help organizations manage security operations more effectively and provide better protection against cyber threats.

  

## Creating Rules

**Determining Goals and Objectives:** 

Before creating rules, it is important to determine the security goals and objectives of the organization. Information such as what types of threats should be detected and which systems or network areas need to be protected are considered in this process.

  

  

**Defining Rule Conditions**

Identifying the conditions that define a particular security event or condition is critical when creating a rule. For instance, you can specify conditions such as a particular user deleting a file or network traffic following a certain pattern.

  

  

**Determining Trigger Match Conditions**

We should define the match conditions required for the rule to trigger. These conditions determine the circumstances under which certain conditions or events come together. For example, a matching condition such as "If Condition 1 AND Condition 2 Match" could be used.

  

  

**Defining Warning or Response Actions**

We should determine what kind of response will be received if the rule is triggered. This may include alerts, notifications, or automated responses to the security team.

  

  

**Customization and Improvement of the Rule**

The created rule can be customized to fit the needs of the organization and improved by regular review. This is important to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the rule.

  

  

## Creating Correlation

**Defining Correlation Relationships**

Correlation rules define relationships between multiple security events or data. For example, we can define relationships such as a user making multiple unsuccessful login attempts within a certain period followed by an attempt to access sensitive data.

  

  

**Determining Correlation Rule Conditions**

Conditions are determined in a similar way for correlation rules. However, these conditions require the combination of multiple security events or data.

  

  

**Defining the Conditions for Triggering the Correlation Rule**

The correlation rule is triggered when it detects that multiple events or data occur in a certain order or timing. This enables the organization to detect more complex threat scenarios.

  

  

**Defining Correlation Rule Responses**

A triggered correlation rule initiates an appropriate response. This response allows the organization to respond quickly and effectively to potential threats.

## Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management solutions help organizations detect and remediate security vulnerabilities. The logs of these solutions contain information about potential vulnerabilities and vulnerability scanning results. By analyzing these logs, SIEM identifies priority vulnerabilities and provides a rapid response.

  

### Rule/Correlation Examples:

  

**Rule Name**: Rapid Patching of Critical Weaknesses

**Conditions**: Detection of a critical vulnerability by the Vulnerability Management system.

**Trigger Condition**: If a critical vulnerability is detected, trigger it to be patched quickly.

  

  

**Rule Name**: Monitoring High Score Weaknesses

**Conditions**: Detection of high-risk (high score) vulnerabilities by the Vulnerability Management system.

**Trigger Condition**: If high-risk vulnerabilities are detected, trigger these vulnerabilities to be monitored.

  

  

**Rule Name**: Warnings from Weakness Parties

**Conditions**: Weaknesses detected by the Vulnerability Management system based on vulnerability scanning results.

**Trigger Condition**: Trigger the detected vulnerabilities based on the vulnerability scan results to be communicated to the SIEM side.

  

  

**Rule Name**: Failure of Vulnerability Scanning Operations

**Conditions**: Failure or blocking of vulnerability scanning by the vulnerability management system.

**Trigger Condition**: Trigger if vulnerability scanning processes are detected to be unsuccessful or blocked.

  

  

## Conclusion/Summary

The sample rules and correlations discussed in this lesson help SIEM systems better monitor organizations' security infrastructure and respond quickly to potential threats. By monitoring data from different technologies such as Firewall, IPS/IDS, WAF, Windows, Linux, network devices, endpoint security, VPN, VM platforms, and vulnerability management, they offer security teams a critical advantage in identifying abnormal activities and blocking threats.

  

These rules and correlations cover different security areas such as network security, system security, access control, and vulnerability management. For example, by examining firewall logs, unauthorized port access attempts can be detected and a rapid response can be provided. Additionally, correlations with endpoint security solutions play an important role in avoiding malware detection.

  

All these examples help organizations strengthen their cybersecurity strategies and minimize security vulnerabilities. However, it is important to remember that every organization has unique needs and security policies. Therefore, it is recommended to customize these sample rules and correlations to suit one’s own needs and technologies.

  

In this part of the training, sample rules for Firewall, IPS/IDS, WAF, Windows, Linux, Network Devices, Endpoint products, VPN, virtual systems, and Vulnerability Management products are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject of “ **Creating Alarms** ” will be explained.

### Creating Alarms

Alarming with SIEM allows organizations to quickly react to security events. This helps identify when hackers or threat actors are trying to penetrate or cause harm. To raise alarms, SIEM monitors many security events or log entries where certain conditions are met. For example, events such as a failed login attempt, virus detection, or network traffic anomalies can be defined as alarm conditions.

  

When creating an alarm with SIEM, the following basic steps are followed:

  

**Defining Rules and Correlations:** SIEM admins determine which events or log entries should trigger an alarm. For example, conditions can be defined as “a certain number of consecutive failed login attempts”.

  

  

**Alert and Notification:** When an alarm is triggered, instant notifications are sent to the security team or relevant persons. These notifications help the organization react quickly.

  

  

**Determining the Actions to be Taken:** The actions to be taken when the alarm is triggered are determined. These actions may include notifying the security team, automatically isolating the incident or other responses. At this stage, SOAR technology also comes into play.

  

In summary; Various alarm types can be created for the rules/correlations created. Each SIEM solution has different alarm creation capabilities. The most commonly used alarm creation methods are:

  

  

**Email Notifications:** SIEM can send automatic email notifications to the security team or other relevant individuals when a specific alarm is triggered. This helps ensure quick response to security incidents.

  

**SMS Notifications:** Some SIEM solutions offer the ability to send SMS notifications on critical security events. In this way, the security team can be quickly notified in cases of emergency.

  

  

**Web-Based Notifications:** Sending web-based notifications through the SIEM console provides the security team with quick access to alerts. Alerts typically appear when users log in to the SIEM console.

  

  

**Mobile App Notifications:** SIEM applications may have the ability to send alarm notifications to security teams via mobile devices. This allows security professionals to receive alerts on the go.

  

  

**Webhooks and API Integrations:** SIEM can send notifications to other applications or messaging platforms (e.g. Slack, Microsoft Teams) via webhooks and API integrations. This allows the security team to receive information using different communication channels.

  

  

**Dashboard and Console Notifications:** The SIEM console visually displays many alerts and security events. The security team can monitor the alarm status by monitoring the console regularly.

  

  

These mechanisms enable the security team to react quickly and effectively to security incidents. Businesses generally optimize security alarm management by configuring these mechanisms in a way that suits their organization.
