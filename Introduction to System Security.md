### System Security Overview

System security is one of the top priorities of a modern business or organization. In today's digital world, security is paramount in dealing with rapidly evolving threats and protecting valuable data, networks and systems.

  

In this course, we will cover the concepts of system security, its basic principles and implementation if the effective measures. One of the key elements of ensuring system security is to take a proactive approach. Therefore, you need to use security policies and up-to-date technologies to avoid the security incidents, identify potential vulnerabilities, and take the right protection measures.

  

System security requires various components such as user authentication, patch, update and upgrade, data encryption, secure network configuration, use of firewall, regular backup and detecting cyber attacks. We will deep dive into more details about each of these components and learn how to implement and manage them effectively.

  

In addition, you will learn about different platforms in terms of system security. Different operating systems and applications such as Windows servers and Active Directory, Linux/Unix servers and log management will be covered as well. In this way, you will understand the security requirements on different platforms and learn to manage application processes.

  

We need to take various measurements and precautions to ensure operating systems’ security. Here are some of the major ones:

  

**User Accounts Management:** It is important to secure user accounts by using strong and complex passwords and to give each user only as much authority as necessary. Management of users includes operations such as creating, disabling or deleting user accounts.

  

**Access Control:** Operating systems have the ability to control the access of users and applications to resources. Properly configuring file and folder permissions, restricting access to network resources, and disabling unnecessary services are all part of access control.

  

**Applying Updates:** Most security vulnerabilities in operating systems can be fixed with a patch or update. Therefore, it is important to regularly go over the released patches and apply the updates to operating systems.

  

**Firewall and Network Configuration:** Firewall monitors network traffic to block malicious attempts. Network configuration requires correct settings to ensure secure communication between devices on the network.

  

**Security Logs and Monitoring:** Operating systems have mechanisms to monitor security events and keep security logs. Security events log the system logins, errors, authorizations, and other important events. These logs should be monitored regularly for abnormal activities or signs of potential attacks.

  

**Malware Protection:** Malware protection is an important component of the system security. Malware is malicious programs designed to damage computer systems, steal user data, or exploit system resources.

  

**Backup and Recovery:** Performing regular backups at the operating system level and establishing recovery mechanisms to restore data are important to prevent data loss in disaster situations and to ensure systems to be restored quickly.

  

**Physical Security:** System security is not only limited to digital security measures, but also includes physical security measures. Physical security refers to the measures taken to protect computer systems against physical threats.

  

System security is one of the most important topic within the cybersecurity realm that is gaining more and more importance today. The security of computer systems and data is a critical issue for businesses, organizations and individuals. Therefore, it is of great importance to have knowledge about system security and to take precautions.

  

In this course, we had a general introduction to overall system security and its basic principles. We will cover the “ **Operating Systems** ” topic in the next part of the training.

First, understanding operating systems helps you identify the security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Understanding the details of components and functions within an operating system will guide you through the process of detecting and remediating potential security vulnerabilities. Thus, you can take appropriate measures to increase system security and make it more resilient to attacks.

  

Second, knowing the operating systems helps you set up and configure your computer properly and apply the proper security settings. Operating systems provide basic security features such as user access control, network configuration, data encryption, and other security measures. Configuring and managing these features properly and effectively is important to maintaining the system security. Knowing the operating systems is the key component to configure these settings properly and enforce your security policies.

  

Also, knowing about different operating systems increases your ability to understand and enforce security requirements across various platforms. For example, implementing security policies on different operating systems such as Windows servers and Active Directory, Linux/Unix servers may require different skills and understanding. Therefore, knowing operating systems helps you effectively manage security practices across different platforms.

  

## Basic Operating System Categories

### Process and Memory Management

For the security engineers, it is important to know that the operating system is basically the interface between hardware and software. It is extremely important to know how the operating systems work and manages both the hardware and the software processes for the incident response and threat hunting operations.

  

We will cover the “Process Management”, “Memory Management”, “File Management” and “Network Management” that the computer operating system manages for us:

  

## Process Management

Operating system process management is the process of an operating system managing all the running processes and allocating resources (memory, CPU time, I/O devices) in a balanced way. The operating system provides an effective and efficient operation by managing the creation of processes, tracking their status, time sharing and prioritization. Some basic concepts of operating system process management are:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Introduction-to-system-security/3/image2-2.png)

  
  

**Process:** A program unit managed by the operating system. Each process can consist of one or more threads and represents a process flow with resource requests.

  

**Process State:** It refers to the states of a process such as running, stand by, and stopping. For example, a running process can be a waiting process or a stopped process.

  

**Process Planning:** The operating system runs the processes in a certain order. Process scheduling uses an algorithm that determines which process will run and when. This algorithm provides fair and efficient access to processes by allocating CPU time.

  

**Time Sharing:** The operating system uses the time sharing method that allows a process to use the CPU for a certain amount of time. Thus, multiple processes can run simultaneously, providing users with a fast response time.

  

**Prioritization:** The operating system assigns priority to processes, giving important processes more resources and processor time. Priority processes are processed earlier than non-priority processes and may demand more resources.

  

**Run Order:** The operating system determines the running order of the processes. While prioritization is used to set priorities, other factors can also have an impact, such as when the process is started or a predetermined time quota.

  

**Synchronism:** The operating system allows multiple processes to run simultaneously. Parallel processing can be performed using multiprocessor or multithreading.

  

## Memory Management

Operating system memory management includes processes that ensure efficient and effective use of system memory. The operating system handles allocating, monitoring, freeing and sharing memory spaces of programs. The basic components and processes of operating system memory management are described below.

  

## Memory Hierarchy

The operating system organizes memory in a hierarchical structure. This hierarchy consists of faster and smaller memory units and can be classified as main memory and virtual memory:

  

**Main Memory:** Main memory, also known as RAM, is the largest unit of memory managed by the operating system. It is where programs and data are stored at runtime.

  

**Virtual Memory:** A memory expansion mechanism created on a hard disk or other storage device, used to support main memory.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Introduction-to-system-security/3/image2-3.png)

  
  

  

  

## Memory Management Operations

  

It includes processes such as allocation, monitoring, freeing and sharing of memory spaces performed by the operating system. Some of the major memory management operations are:

  

**Allocation:** The operating system allocates memory space to running programs. This process determines the amount of memory the programs need and allocates the appropriate memory blocks.

  

**Tracking:** The operating system monitors the status of allocated memory blocks. This allows tracking of used and free memory blocks.

  

**Deallocation:** When programs no longer use memory, the operating system reclaims and frees these memory blocks which then become usable again.

  

**Memory Sharing:** The operating system allows multiple programs to share the same memory blocks. This optimizes memory usage and allocates resources effectively.

  

## Memory Management Strategies

These are methods used by the operating system and allow efficient and effective management of memory. Operating system memory management strategies address memory allocation, memory freeing, memory sharing, and memory fragmentation. Some common memory management strategies are:

  

**Physical Memory Management:** The operating system allocates physical memory blocks to programs and performs monitor. "First-fit" (first fit), "Best-fit" (best fit), and "Worst-fit" (worst fit) are some of the Physical Memory Management strategies.

  

**Virtual Memory Management:** The operating system manages memory in a structure that can switch between main memory and virtual memory. This allows more programs to run and optimizes memory usage.

  

Operating system memory management is important for optimizing system performance and resource usage. Proper memory allocation, avoiding memory bottlenecks, and ensuring efficient memory usage improves overall system performance and stability.

  

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the process and memory management concepts. We will learn about the “ **File and Network Management in Operating System** ” in the next part of the training.

### File and Network Management

## File Management

Operating system file management includes a set of operations like storing the users and systems data, access, and management processes of the data. The operating system handles the creation, naming, organization, storage, protection, and deletion of files. Here are some important concepts and operations related to file management:

  

**File:** A unit where information is stored and named in a structured way. Files can be of different types, such as documents, programs, databases, or media files.

  

**Filesystem:** It is the system that provides the organization and storage of files. File systems include partitioning files into volumes, creating directories, controlling access rights, and placing data on physical storage media.

  

**File Naming:** It is the naming method used to identify and access files. File naming allows identifying unique and meaningful names and facilitating access to files.

  

**File Access:** It includes operations such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting files. The operating system controls file access and allows users or programs to access files.

  

**File Directories:** File systems use directories to organize and manage files. Directories contain structures in which files are hierarchically structured and grouped. Folders or directories keep files together and provide file organization to users.

  

**File Security:** File security ensures that files can be accessed and protected by authorized users. The operating system maintains file security by managing access rights and permissions.

  

**File Backup:** File backup includes making backup copies of files to prevent data loss and support data recovery processes. The operating system supports file backup policies and methods.

  

**Disk Management:** It includes the processes by which files are managed on physical storage media. Disk management includes operations such as storing data, allocating disk space, disk partitioning, and data recovery.

  

File management ensures that data is stored, accessed, and protected in an organized manner through a set of services and operations provided by the operating system. In this way, users and systems can regularly manage their data and access it when necessary.

## Network Management

Operating system network management includes processes that enable efficient and secure management of computer systems and network resources in a network environment. Network management includes a number of tasks such as configuring and monitoring network resources, optimizing performance, securing and troubleshooting. Here are some basics about network management:

  

**Network Topology and Configuration:** Operating system network management determines how devices on the network are physically or logically combined and configured. This includes processes such as selection of network topology, configuration of network components, IP addressing, subnetting and management of network devices.

  

**Network Security:** Operating system network management implements various security measures to secure the network. This includes security mechanisms such as firewalls, network access control, encryption, authorization and authentication. It also monitors for security vulnerabilities in the network and takes corrective action.

  

**Network Monitoring and Performance Optimization:** Operating system network management monitors and optimizes the performance of devices, connections and applications on the network. This includes operations such as network traffic analysis, bandwidth management, detection of performance issues (such as speed and efficiency issues), and the capacity planning of network resources.

  

**Network Services Management:** Operating system network management provides the management of services offered in the network such as configuration, management and monitoring of network services like Domain Name System (DNS) server, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, and file sharing service.

  

**Network Troubleshooting:** Operating system network management provides tools and methods for detecting, diagnosing, and resolving problems on the network. This includes network monitoring tools, debugging techniques, and troubleshooting methods.

  

**Network Backup and Recovery:** The operating system provides network management, backup of data on the network and recovery when necessary. This includes creating data backup strategies, backup devices, and recovery plans.

  

Operating system network management is essential to ensure the smooth operation, security, and performance of the network. Network management aims to ensure that the devices connected to the network communicate and work in harmony efficiently.

### Patch Management, Update and Upgrade

“Patch Management, Update and Upgrade” is an important issue in terms of system security. These processes ensure that operating systems, software, and other components are kept up-to-date and in a secure state.

  

**Patch:** A patch in the security world refers to a software update that is released by a vendor to fix a vulnerability or security issue in their software.

  

**Update** : It is the replacement of the current version of the software with a new version released to fix bugs, improve performance and fix security vulnerabilities.

Updates are delivered regularly by software developers and often fix bugs and security vulnerabilities add new features to the software. Regular application of updates increases system security and reduces potential attack points. Therefore, users should keep their software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest updates.

  

**Upgrade** : It means to upgrade from the previous version of the software to a newer version.

This process is done to use the newer and more advanced version of the software. Upgrades often introduce new features, enhancements, and performance improvements. It also remediates security vulnerabilities and enables users to have a better user experience. Upgrades are offered by software developers on a set schedule. Users perform the upgrade process to replace the current software version with the new version.

  

The important points that Security Engineers should know about Update & Upgrade are as follows;

  

**The Importance of Update & Upgrade**

Security Engineers must understand the importance of the update and upgrade processes to keep the system up-to-date and secure. These processes fix the bugs and  vulnerabilities and keep the software and operating systems up to date.

  

**Patch Management**

Security Engineers must be familiar with the patch management processes for the effective application of updates. These processes include regular monitoring, evaluation, testing and distribution of updates.

  

**Risk assessment**

Security Engineers should be able to assess the potential risks of update and upgrade processes and implement risk management strategies. This ensures that updates or upgrades can be applied to the system without any adverse effects.

  

**Return Strategies**

Security Engineers should know and apply fallback strategies against problems that may occur after an update or upgrade. This ensures that updates can be rolled back or systems can be restored as needed.

  

**Application Compatibility**

Security Engineers must evaluate the compatibility of applications and systems during the update or upgrade process and ensure their work in a harmony. This ensures uninterrupted operation and compliant updating of systems.

  

**Automatic Update and Upgrade Methods**

Security Engineers must ensure that systems are kept up to date securely, knowing automatic update and upgrade methods. These methods make it easy to constantly monitor and apply updates.

  

**Update Tracking and Reporting**

Security Engineers should monitor the update and upgrade processes, use appropriate reporting mechanisms, and regularly provide administrators with information about the up-to-dateness of the system.

  

This information supports Security Engineers to effectively manage the update and upgrade processes and ensure system security. It is also important that they follow current trends and best practices for updating and upgrading.

  

In this part of the training we have covered Patch, Update and Upgrade concept and their importance. We will be learning about the “ **Log Infrastructure** ” topic in the next part of the training.

### Log Infrastructure

**Logs** : A log is a record of events that have occurred on a computer network. These events can include security-related events, system errors, and other types of activities.

Log infrastructure refers to the structures and processes used to collect, process, store and monitor these logs.

  

## Purpose and Importance of Log Infrastructure

Log infrastructure refers to the structures and processes required for recording and monitoring events that occur in a system. Below is the detailed information about the importance and purpose of the log infrastructure:

  

**Problem Diagnosis and Debugging:** Logs are important tools to track events that occur in the system and to detect problems. In case of system errors, logs are valuable resource for determining the root cause of the issue and their effects on the system. Log monitoring and analysis play important role in the debugging process.

  

**Detection of Security Events:** Logs are used to detect and respond to security events. Situations such as abnormal activities, security breaches or unauthorized access attempts in the system can be detected through logs. Logs are used to respond to security incidents early and prevent malicious activities.

  

**Performance Analysis and Optimization:** Logs are used to monitor and analyze system performance. The data in the logs is used to identify system resource usage, high processing times, excessive demands, and performance issues. This data is used to optimize and improve system performance.

  

**Legal and Regulatory Compliance:** In many industries, legal and regulatory requirements dictate that system logs must be collected and stored on a regular basis. Logs provide evidence that can be used for audit purposes and support compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

  

**Event Monitoring and Audit Purposes:** Logs are used to monitor and audit the events of a system. Information such as usernames performing their actions, files accessed, network connections made can be tracked through logs. This is important for monitoring system activities and ensuring compliance with audit objectives.

(Image Source: https://www.site24x7.com/blog/top-log-monitoring-tools )

  
  

## The Role and Importance of Logs on System Security

The role of logs on system security is very important. Here are more details about the role of logs on the system security:

  

**Intrusion Detection:** Logs record and monitor any activity done to the system. These activities include unauthorized access attempts, attacks, or abnormal behaviors. The data in the logs can be used to detect potential threats and prevent attacks. Security events and abnormal activities can be identified through the logs and immediate incident resppnse can be conducted accordingly.

  

**Traceability/Visibility:** Logs record and monitor all transactions made to the system and are important tools for tracking user activities and changes in the system. In this way, it is possible to track and determine all the actions; when they are performed and by whom. Traceability plays a critical role in the incident investigation, from the user accountability aspect and audit purposes.

  

**Audit and Compliance:** Logs are an important resource for meeting legal and regulatory requirements. In many industries, regular collection and storage of logs is required. Logs provide evidence that can be used in audit processes and help verify whether compliance requirements are met.

  

**Security Analysis and Improvement:** Logs play an important role in security analysis and system improvement processes. The data in the logs can be used to analyze security events, identify attack trends, and update security measures. Log analysis is important for detecting vulnerabilities and continuously improving system security.

  

**Investigation and Legal Purposes:** Logs also play an important role in investigation processes and for legal purposes. Logs about security events or unauthorized access attempts that occur on the system provide how the events occurred, who is responsible, and potential evidence. This information can be used in investigation processes and legal proceedings.

  

_You can address all of the above topics with various SIEM solutions via:_

**Log Data Collection and Normalization:** Collects and normalizes log data from SIEM systems, network and security devices, applications, and other sources. This allows logs from different sources to be combined and analyzed in the same format.

  

**Event Monitoring and Analysis:** SIEM systems analyze the collected log data and identify abnormal or suspicious events. This could be a sign of an attack attempt or a security breach.

  

**Alerts and Reporting:** SIEM systems usually generate alerts when they detect certain events. In addition, they often generate regular reports on system status and security events.

  

**Incident Response:** SIEM systems often include the ability to automatically respond to specific events. This could be, for example, automatically isolating a security breach or blocking an attack.

  

To underline the importance of the SIEM; the SIEM tools offer the ability to collect and analyze log data from a wide variety of sources and use that data to identify and respond to security threats. This makes the SIEM tools critical for system security.

  

## Log Storage and Archiving

Log Storage and Archiving is an important step for Log Management to ensure that the log data is stored for a long time and can be accessed when necessary.

How long the logs will be retained should be determined based on business needs and compliance requirements. Keeping logs for a certain period of time is important for investigation, audit and legal purposes. Legislation or industry standards may require specific retention periods. Different methods can be used to store logs. These may include databases, file systems, custom log management systems, or cloud-based services. The method chosen should depend on factors such as data security, performance, and scalability.

  

It is important that the archives where the logs are stored are easily accessible when needed. Log archives should be accessible to authorized personnel for investigation, analysis or audit purposes. Access controls and authorization mechanisms ensure that log data is protected from unauthorized access. The management of the log archiving process is also important. This process includes steps such as managing archived logs, updating them regularly, cleaning unnecessary data, and making appropriate documentation. In addition, the performance and integrity of archiving systems should be checked regularly.

  

Log Retention and Archiving is important to preserve the value of log data, facilitate the detection and investigation of security incidents, ensure regulatory compliance, and support audit processes. This process is a critical component to the security of the system and must be properly managed.

  

In conclusion, log infrastructure plays an important role in monitoring events in a system, detecting problems, ensuring security, analyzing performance and supporting regulatory compliance. Accurate collection, analysis and protection of logs is critical for system security and management.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered what the log is, the role and importance of logs in system security, the purpose and importance of log infrastructure, log storage and archiving.
