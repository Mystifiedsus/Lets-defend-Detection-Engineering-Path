### Understanding of CTI Concept

Cyber security is more critical than ever due to the increasing cyber threats today. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is a vital tool to strengthen our defenses against these threats.

Cyber Threat Intelligence refers to information used to identify, analyze and evaluate potential or existing cyber threats. This information helps organizations deal with cyber threats more effectively.

As we face increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, having advance knowledge is critical to creating a proactive defense strategy. CTI increases our ability to understand how attacks occur and develop strategies to protect against those attacks.

This information can be collected from many different sources such as open source intelligence, human intelligence, technical intelligence. In addition, private cybersecurity firms and government agencies are also important sources of intelligence.

Cyber Threat Intelligence, or CTI in short, includes information that helps us understand, prevent and take proactive measures against cyber threats. Nowadays, attackers are constantly developing new attack methods and techniques. That's why the role of CTI is increasing. We can collect the benefits we will gain while managing our risks with CTI under two main headings: The first of these is the determination of our potential threats, and the second is the determination of our security vulnerabilities.

Now let's take a closer look at these.

  

## Identifying Potential Threats

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**

OSINT describes intelligence obtained by analyzing information collected from publicly available sources. This is an indispensable tool not only for cybersecurity experts, but also for journalists, researchers and many other professionals.

We can obtain information about potential threats by collecting information on the Internet, forums, blogs, social media and many other sources. OSINT is often an ideal source for accessing information about the methods attackers use, the tools they use, and how these tools are used.

So, what resources are used for OSINT?

  

  

**Digital Media:** News sites, blogs, podcasts and online publications.

**Social Media:** Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and other social media platforms.

**Academic Resources:** Online articles, theses, conferences and seminars.

**Government and Public Resources:** Public databases, official documents and reports.

**Maps and Geographic Information Systems:** Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and other map services.

**Forums and Communities:** Special forums and communities on the deep web or surface web.

  

Even though we have summarized the resources mentioned above with just a few items, I am sure you have noticed how large a data pool it actually covers. There are also tools we can use to make it easier to find what we are looking for in this huge data pool:

  

**Search Engines:** Using advanced search parameters of search engines such as Google, Bing, Yandex and DuckDuckGo.

**Social Media Tools:** TweetDeck, Social Mention and others.

**Databases** Shodan, Censys and others.

**Image and Video Analysis:** Google Image Search and InVID.

  

As you will have noticed, OSINT has the same data, resources and tools from start to finish for us on the defense side and the attackers. Therefore, our main priority should be to learn how to use these methods, tools and resources systematically and regularly and be one step ahead of threat actors.

  

## Technical Intelligence (TECHINT)

Technical Intelligence is intelligence obtained by analyzing information collected through technological tools, and its scope actually ranges from satellite and radar data. In Cybersecurity, our topic in this course, this is often used to understand attackers' techniques, tactics and operations.

When it comes to everyday cybersecurity, TECHINT is often achieved by analyzing malware or zero-day vulnerabilities. It helps us understand what vulnerabilities attackers are using and how they are using them.

We can also examine TECHINT under the following headings:

  

**Signals Intelligence (SIGINT):** Collected by monitoring communication signals and data transfer.

**Computer Network Intelligence (CNA):** Used to monitor, analyze and take countermeasures against potential cyber threats.

**Malware Analysis:** In-depth investigations to understand the functions and purposes of malware.

  

When we examine it in terms of the tools and methods used, a grouping as follows will be appropriate:

  

**Traffic Analysis:** Used to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activities.

**Sandbox Environments:** Used to analyze the behavior of malware by running it in a secure environment.

**Honeypot Systems:** Creating deceptive systems to detect attackers and learn their techniques.

**OSINT Tools:** Used to collect information about cyber threats from open sources.

  

Even though we are covering TECHINT within the scope of CTI in this course, there is one detail we need to remember: TECHINT methods and techniques are an indispensable topic in many cyber security processes such as threat hunting and incident response.

  

## Human Intelligence (HUMINT)

HUMINT is the act of gathering information directly from a human source. Although it is associated with espionage activities in classical intelligence, there are similar tactics and methods in cyber security.

Through security communities, forums or closed networks, it is possible to obtain information about attackers' tendencies, movements and plans.

In the cyber world, technical intelligence methods often come to the fore, but we must not forget that even the most sophisticated attacks often involve a human factor. Therefore, understanding and application of HUMINT in this field is critical.

There is no doubt that it is not possible to examine a study whose subject is humans under several headings. But still, we can use the following titles as HUMINT sources:

  

**Social Engineering:** A technique of gathering information or gaining access to a network by manipulating target individuals.

**Deep Web and Dark Web Research:** Actively gathering information in hidden online forums, marketplaces, and other platforms.

**Insider Information:** Gathering information from a source that provides information from within the organization or closely.

The data collected from these sources has the potential to produce very useful outputs on the following topics:

**Detection of Weaknesses:** Ability to detect human weaknesses that are more dangerous than technical weaknesses.

**Understanding Advanced Threat Actors:** Gaining insight into actors' motivations, goals, and methods.

**Preventive Intelligence:** It provides the capacity to detect potential threats in advance and take precautions.

The most important detail that should not be forgotten about HUMINT is that this technique is used quite frequently and professionally by attackers. The history of the cyber security world is full of many events that started with simple Social Engineering studies and produced results that concern the whole world. Therefore, mastering these techniques is very important both to understand that we are a target and to identify our weak points.

  

## Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability Scanners

In the chapter so far, we have gained an idea of how we can identify our potential threats by looking at ourselves from the outside. In other words, we now know what we look like through the attacker's eyes. So, when we are at the center of a targeted attack by a person/group with this information, how do we know the risks that will make the attacker's job easier and leave us in a difficult situation?

First of all, we need to remember the cliché “a chain is only as strong as its weakest link”. No matter how cliché it is, this simple sentence is still very valid when it comes to cybersecurity. It may not always be possible to eliminate all risks, but we can always know our risks.

Vulnerability scanning systems are indispensable tools for us to know these risks before the attackers (at least as much as they do). These tools and systems are designed to constantly scan your organization and report possible weaknesses to you. As you can imagine, there are many solutions on this issue and they all have their pros and cons.

Although databases such as CVE are public databases, monitoring 24/7 whether you have software/hardware/services affected by vulnerabilities published in these databases ( [https://cve.mitre.org/ ) is a very complex and effort-consuming process.](https://cve.mitre.org/) Vulnerability scanners are our most important assistant in this regard.

As a cyber security professional, our duty is to first determine our needs correctly and then identify the product or products that best meet these needs (yes, sometimes it is not possible to achieve this with a single product).

## Threat Reports

Manufacturers of the security products we use, security firms, and researchers often publish reports on current threats. These reports provide knowledge of active threats and the vulnerabilities targeted by these threats.

Apart from these publicly available reports, there are also companies that conduct research and monitoring specific to your organization and provide information specific to your organization.

Threat reports detail who specific threat actors are, what motivations they have, and what tools, tactics, and procedures (TTP) they use.

The reports contain details about the specific systems, applications and platforms targeted by attackers, the actively targeted security vulnerabilities and how these vulnerabilities are exploited, what types of attack methods are used, what stages they consist of, and how these attacks can be detected and prevented.

Threat reports are essential to taking a proactive approach to cybersecurity. Up-to-date threat information enables organizations to be better prepared against possible attacks and to use their resources in the most effective way. Additionally, these reports are a tool for sector-wide information sharing and collaboration, which helps build a collective defense capacity.

  

## Information Sharing Platforms

Information sharing platforms enable the rapid and effective sharing of threat information, especially in the field of cybersecurity. These platforms enable organizations to react faster and more informed to potential cyber threats.

There are many services specialized in this field, let's share a few to give you an idea:

  

**MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing)**

It is an open source threat information sharing platform. It contains detailed information about threat indicators, tactics, techniques and attack procedures.

  

**FS-ISAC (Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center)**

It is a platform that provides information sharing for the financial sector. It makes it easier to share cyber threat information between financial institutions.

  

**OTX (Open Threat Exchange)**

Provided by AlienVault, this platform allows users to share threat indicators, analysis and discussions.

  

There are many advantages to using this type of platforms. Now let's take a look at these:

  

**Automation:** Modern platforms automatically collect, analyze and share threat indicators.

**Standardization:** Standard formats are generally used to share information. For example, protocols such as STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) and TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) enable threat information to be shared in a consistent and compatible manner.

**Privacy and Anonymity:** Many platforms allow organizations to hide their identities when sharing information. This is especially important when sharing sensitive information.

**Collaborative Analysis:** Some platforms allow users to work collaboratively on threat information, so the community has a broader perspective on threats.

**Customization:** Organizations can filter threat information according to their needs and industry characteristics.

  

We think you immediately understood the importance of these environments where the findings determined by many security professionals like you are shared in a well-documented manner. Your part is to correctly determine how to weight which data from which source and integrate them into your processes.

  

In this part of the training, some issues that need to be known when managing risks with CTI are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject “ **Introduction to Darkweb** ” is explained.

### Introduction to Darkweb

## What is DarkWeb?

Before we get into the subject of monitoring the dark web, let's quickly learn what the dark web is.

The darkweb is a hidden part of the Internet that is generally not accessible through standard browsers and search engines. Access to the darkweb is achieved using special browsers (e.g. Tor Browser) and technologies.

One of its most distinctive features is that it offers an environment where users and websites remain anonymous. This provides an avenue for both legitimate and illegal activities.

Access to darkweb sites is provided through private networks such as Tor (The Onion Router). These networks provide anonymity by hiding users' real IP addresses.

Darkweb sites usually have the ".onion" extension and can only be accessed through the Tor browser.

There is many different content on the darkweb. While these include legitimate content such as political activism, censorship evasion, journalism, and more, unfortunately the Darkweb is also used for illegal activities, drug dealing, arms sales, cybercrime, and much more negative content.

Extreme care should be taken when navigating this area as it is a popular area for cybercriminals. Malware, fake sites and other threats pose a constant risk to visitors.

The darkweb can be likened to the part of the internet that is just above the surface of the iceberg. While the so-called “Surface Web” constitutes only a small part of the internet we use on a daily basis, the Deep Web and Darkweb are larger and difficult to access parts of the internet. Conscious and ethical use of these concepts is especially important for cybersecurity professionals.

Well, we talked about three different concepts, “Surface Web”, “Deep Web” and “Dark Net”. It would be very useful to take a quick look at what these are.

  

**Surface Web**

It covers the websites we use daily and can access with standard web browsers. For example, news sites, social media platforms, online shopping sites, etc.

Access to information on the Surface Web is possible through standard search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.).

It usually contains information that is recorded and publicly available. Most of the content is publicly available.

  

**Deep Web**

It is the part of the internet that is not indexed by standard search engines. Therefore, it is difficult to access these contents without a direct access link.

Deep Web content can be accessed via direct links, database queries, or private networks. For example, academic databases, private social media profiles, personal email inboxes, and some government resources are included in the Deep Web.

The Deep Web makes up a large part of the internet. This only includes information that is not indexed or accessed with special permissions. Although it has a "profound" name, most of the content is innocent.

  

**DarkWeb**

Anonymous part of the internet accessed using private browsers and networks (e.g. Tor, I2P). It often hosts illegal activities, but it also has legitimate uses such as activism and uncensored communications.

Access to the darkweb is achieved using special browsers (e.g. Tor Browser). These sites usually have special domain extensions such as ".onion".

The darkweb provides users and operators with a high degree of anonymity. This provides an avenue for both legitimate and illegal activities. Although it is used for drug dealing, arms sales, cybercrime activities, and similar illegal activities, it can also be an important platform for journalists, activists, and individuals under repressive regimes to evade censorship.

  

## DarkWeb in Cyber Security

We have seen the importance of the Dark Web to threat actors. Since our job is to manage threats and take precautions, this area is very important for us. So, for what purposes can we use DarkWeb?

  

**Threat Intelligence Source**

Darkweb is one of the main platforms on which cybercriminals and hacker groups operate. Therefore, security experts can refer to the information here for early identification of threats and attack techniques. For example, when attackers say that they have accessed a system belonging to company Y using application We need to know/detect whether we or a business partner is using application X.

  

**Detection of Leaked Information**

On the darkweb, information leaked from major data breaches is frequently offered for sale. If, despite all the precautions we have taken, we have become the target of a cyber attack due to a detail we overlooked, the first place we can notice this is the DarkWeb. We can react early by checking whether the information of our organization, our employees or our customers is on these platforms.

At this point, there is a detail we need to understand well. Data circulating on the DarkWeb may not be directly related to our institution, but it may pose serious risks for us. For example, imagine that some data is leaked from the computer an employee uses at home. This data includes the passwords used by the employee for personal accounts, etc. It may be the same as the ones they use within the organization. Or, access information belonging to a business partner or one of its employees may be the signal for a chain disaster that will first lead to unauthorized access to that institution and then to our system through the common services/systems we use for business.

  

**Zero-Day Vulnerabilities and Exploits**

On the darkweb, security vulnerabilities (zero-day) that have not yet been disclosed to the public and exploits prepared to infiltrate systems using these vulnerabilities can be offered for sale. This is almost a daily routine on the DarkWeb, and every day dozens of application vulnerabilities and methods/software that exploit them are offered for sale. It is very critical to follow this market correctly, identify vulnerabilities that may affect our institution and take precautions. In many cases, attackers appear to have made good use of the few days that passed between the manufacturer's discovery of the vulnerability and the release of the patch, and the patch's implementation by the institutions.

  

**X As a Service**

The darkweb has become a marketplace for selling cybercrime services such as ransomware attacks and DDoS services. By monitoring the sale of such services, security experts can identify potential threats in advance.

  

**Activist and Rebel Groups**

In regions with repressive regimes or censorship, activists and rebel groups may use the Darkweb for communication and organization. You may be the target of these organizations directly due to the scope of your work, or just the geographical location of your institution, etc. You may have a hard time because it falls within the scope of the target of these groups. For example, an activist group may target your country for any reason, and you may be the target of a potential DDoS attack just because you are an institution doing business in this country. Being informed about such activities in advance will give you time to take precautions.

  

**Advanced Technical Information Sharing**

On the darkweb, advanced technical information is shared between cyber attackers. This provides security experts with the opportunity to understand new techniques and methods that attackers may use.

  

**Tor, I2P, Freenet**

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/2/cti2.png)

  
  

The underlying technologies underlying the darkweb and hidden internet services are designed to provide anonymity and privacy to users. Although there are many projects that have set out to serve this purpose, the most commonly used technologies are Tor, I2P and Freenet. Now let's take a look at their features:

  

**Tor**

Tor is free software that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. Thanks to the layered encryption method, also known as "Onion Router", the user's IP address is routed between multiple random nodes.

Traffic moving on the Tor network passes through different nodes in an encrypted form, and these nodes on the route have no information about the actual source of the traffic. Due to this working logic, it provides considerable anonymity to attackers.

Tor is a browser-based system used for anonymous web browsing, accessing blocked sites, and accessing private websites with ".onion" extensions.

  

  

**I2P (Invisible Internet Project)**

I2P is a protocol that aims to create an anonymous and secure communication layer. Unlike Tor, it is designed specifically for peer-to-peer communication.

Similar to Tor, I2P encrypts users' internet traffic and routes that traffic through a network of nodes operated by volunteers around the world. However, unlike I2P Tor, it uses a distributed hash table (DHT) for traffic routing rather than a central directory. This feature makes it more difficult to censor or block I2P traffic because no central structure is used like in TOR.

I2P also uses a layered architecture, unlike Tor. This ensures that different types of applications can run on the network. This makes it more versatile than Tor, since Tor is mainly used for web browsing.

  

**freenet**

Freenet is a platform that allows users to share files and publish web content anonymously. File sharing, anonymous websites, forums.

It has a distributed storage structure. That is, files are divided into pieces and stored on multiple computers. It has high encryption standards. It offers a platform where users can create and share content, making it immune to censorship.

As we can see in the image and explanations above, although each of these services differ from each other in terms of their working methods, they offer a comfortable working space for threat actors. Therefore, it is vital that we know these technologies and follow what is happening on these networks to stay safe.

In the next lessons, we will examine how to monitor what is happening on the DarkWeb and how to collect intelligence.

  

In this part of the training, what the darkweb is, the importance and use of the darkweb in cyber security are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject of “ **Monitoring Darkweb** ” is explained.

### Monitoring Darkweb

Gathering threat intelligence on the darkweb is an important area of research for cybersecurity professionals. For security experts, tracking the information coming from here is critical to detect threats at an early stage and take precautions.

Manually monitoring activities deep within the darkweb is both time consuming and nearly impossible to provide effective monitoring over a very large area. Therefore, automated monitoring tools and techniques are used to overcome these challenges.

Manually monitoring activities deep within the darkweb is both time consuming and nearly impossible to provide effective monitoring over a very large area. Therefore, automated monitoring tools and techniques are used to overcome these challenges.

  

## Web Crawlers

Specially configured web browsers can programmatically and automatically visit Darkweb sites and collect content. These crawlers discover sites with special ".onion" extensions and are used to crawl and index information on these sites on a regular basis. The data obtained in this way is passed through various language and text analysis tools to obtain results.

  

## Language and Text Analysis Tools

It uses natural language processing (NLP) and other text analysis techniques to analyze the collected data. These tools are extremely useful, especially when searching for specific keywords, topics or trends.

  

## Threat Intelligence Platforms

These platforms work with professional teams for the work we summarized in the two headings above. It combines and analyzes data collected from various sources. For example, platforms such as Insight, Recorded Future, FE Intelligence, Crowdstrike combine data from the Darkweb with intelligence from other sources to provide a broad threat landscape. Depending on the features of the platform, they can make special reports for you. In this way, you can be informed in real time about what is happening with your institution, employees and business partners, without spending any development/operation effort.

  

## Connecting to the Tor Network

**Linux (Ubuntu)**

There is an old version of Tor in the Ubuntu standard repos and it will cause you problems. Therefore, we will proceed by following the installation instructions on torproject.org.

                    `dpkg --print-architecture`
                  CopyCopyCopy

APT uses HTTP by default, while TOR repos use HTTPS. Therefore, we need to install a package required for the APT package manager on your system to use HTTPS:

                    `apt install apt-transport-https`
                  CopyCopyCopy

First, we need to learn our current architecture and take note of it:

                    `dpkg --print-architecture`
                  CopyCopyCopy

In our lab environment, the output of this command returned as **amd64** and we noted this. Now we can introduce torproject's repos to the system ( Note that we defined **the amd64** information we just obtained in **the arch= parameter.**

                    `echo "deb [arch= amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main " >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list`
                  CopyCopyCopy

                    `echo "deb -src [arch= amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main " >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list`
                  CopyCopyCopy

When we ran these two commands respectively, we created the tor.list file under the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory and wrote the definitions we needed into this file.

In the next stage, we need to add the signature file related to these newly added resources to the system:

                    `wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null`
                  CopyCopyCopy

Now that we have solved this, we can first update the apt database, then install the tor core package and run the tor service:

                    `apt update apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring`
                  CopyCopyCopy

Now we can run the Tor Core service :

                    `systemctl start tor`
                  CopyCopyCopy

Finally, you can run the following command to make sure the service is running:

                    `sudo systemctl status tor`
                  CopyCopyCopy

If everything is OK, you will be presented with an output like the one below. The phrase “Active: active” indicates that the service is running smoothly.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/3/cti5.png)

  
  

Now that Tor Core is running smoothly, we can now install Tor Browser. For this, we first turn to user rights. It is strongly not recommended to run Tor Browser as root.

                    `wget https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/12.5.2/tor-browser-linux64-12.5.2_ALL.tar.xz`
                  CopyCopyCopy

After downloading, we need to unzip the archive:

                    `tar -xf tor-browser-linux64-12.5.2_ALL.tar.xz`
                  CopyCopyCopy

Then, we go to the directory where the archive is opened and run **the start-tor-browser.desktop** script and the process is complete:

                    `cd tor browser ./start-tor-browser.desktop`
                  CopyCopyCopy

If everything went well, Tor Browser should have greeted us with a screenshot like the one below:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/3/cti6.png)

  
  

After pressing the Connect button, we will be able to access addresses with .onion extension.

  

### **MacOs**

For MacOs, installing Tor is very easy, just go to "https://www.torproject.org/download/" , select the MacOs package from the screen below, open the DMG package and move it to the Application folder:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/3/cti7.png)

  
  
  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/3/cti8.png)

  
  

## TorBot

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/3/n1.png)

  
  

If you want to create your own DarkWeb intelligence service outside of threat intelligence platforms, you can develop your own crawler tools, as we have shown in Python lessons before.

In this lesson, we will use the TorBot application, which is also developed with Python and distributed as open source. TorBot is an open source tool developed by OWASP to collect information on the Darkweb. It is used to discover hidden services on the Tor network by scanning sites with the ".onion" extension and indexing information.

With this application, which is very simple to install and use, you can run spiders running on the Tor network in a few steps and scan the Tor network for certain keywords. (TorBot was able to perform the following functions at the time this course was prepared and was continuing to be developed.)

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/3/mon-table.png)

  
  

To run TorBot,

## Firefox Monitor

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Cyber+Threat+Intelligence+for+Detection/3/n3.png)

  
  

Firefox Monitor is a free service that allows you to query whether there is a leak regarding the email address you have provided within the data it has indexed since 2007. With what we learned in the Python course, you can quickly and easily write a script that queries your employees' information.

You can even save these addresses to the Firefox monitor service and have it generate an alarm in case of any leaks.

In this part of the training, some issues regarding monitoring the darkweb are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject “ **Malware, IOCs, Threat Groups** ” is explained.

### Malware, IOCs, Threat Groups

In this lesson, we will focus on concepts such as Malware, IOC, Threat Groups. These concepts enable security professionals to use the same language in all processes, from threat intelligence to incident response.

Now let's start with what is Malware:

  

## Malware

It is an abbreviation for "MALicious softWARE" (malware). It is software designed to damage computers, servers, mobile devices and information systems, to use these systems in undesirable ways or to steal sensitive data of both individuals and organizations.

There are many different types and variations of malware. Here are the most common types of malware:

  

**Virus:** Malicious software that infects other programs and is activated when these programs are run.

  

**Worm:** It is a type of malware that can run on its own and spread from system to system. Worms spread to other computers using networks.

  

**Trojan:** Software that appears to be useful or entertaining, but actually has malicious functions.

  

**Ransomware:** Malware that locks a device or the files on it and demands a ransom from the user to unlock the files or device.

  

**Spyware:** Software that collects information without the user's knowledge and shares this information with third parties.

  

**Adware:** Software that disrupts the user's internet experience by displaying unwanted ads or changing browser settings.

  

**Keylogger:** Software that records the user's keyboard keystrokes and sends this information to malicious people.

  

**Botnet:** Networks where many infected devices are controlled by a central command and control server. These networks are often used for DDoS attacks, spamming, and other malicious activities.

  

**Rootkit:** Software that hides its existence and masks malicious activities by infiltrating deeper levels of the system, usually the operating system kernel.

  

While it may not be possible to include all malware in these definitions, a malware may fall under several of the headings we have listed here.

Malware usually infects a system by tricking users, exploiting security vulnerabilities, or by being installed by other malware. Therefore, it is important to adopt best practices such as using up-to-date antivirus software, updating software and the operating system regularly, and not clicking on suspicious email attachments or links.

  

## IOC

IOC is an abbreviation for "Indicator of Compromise". In cybersecurity, IOC refers to technical data that helps determine whether a computer network or system is under the influence of malicious activity.

IOCs are used to detect the first signs of a security incident or breach, which is critical for early intervention and establishing an effective response strategy. Additionally, these symptoms can also be used to understand an attacker's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP).

Examples of IOCs include:

  

**IP Addresses:** Used to detect suspicious or malicious traffic based on its source or destination.

  

**URLs and Domain Names:** URLs or domains where malware is known to communicate with command and control servers or distribute malicious content.

  

**Email Signatures:** Used to detect malicious email campaigns, these signatures typically include the email's title, sender's address, or other unique characteristics found in the email.

  

**File Hash Values:** Used to detect malware or suspicious files. MD5 contains unique values created with hash algorithms such as SHA-1 or SHA-256.

  

**File Paths and Names:** Locations of malicious files or suspicious files leaked into the system.

  

**Malware remnants:** Certain traces, especially registry keys, filenames, and other system changes.

  

IOCs are used by threat intelligence platforms, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, network monitoring tools, and other security tools. However, IOCs can change constantly, so security teams need to keep these signs constantly updated and constantly monitor for new threats.

  
  

## Threat Groups

“Threat Groups,” in the context of cybersecurity, are organized groups of malicious actors who act to serve a specific purpose or agenda and often share common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

These groups may have different motivations: state-sponsored cyberespionage, financial gain, activist goals, or ideological reasons. Understanding the existence and activities of threat groups is an important part of an organization's cyber defense strategy.

Here are some key things to know about threat groups:

  

**State-Sponsored Groups**

These groups are often supported by national governments and act for the purposes of national security, cyber espionage or cyber warfare. These are capable of executing highly sophisticated attacks, often against high-profile targets.

  

**Financially Motivated Groups**

The main purpose of these groups is usually to gain financial gain. Ransomware attacks, bank theft, or theft of credit card information are common actions for such groups.

  

**Hacktivists**

**I** ndividuals or groups who believe in political or social causes carry out cyber attacks to send messages to their targets.

  

**Terrorist Groups**

These groups may use cyber attacks to serve their ideological or political goals.

  

**Criminals**

Individual criminals or more organized criminal groups may commit cybercrime for financial gain.

  

Threat groups often adopt specific TTPs. This can help security researchers and analysts identify these groups and the campaigns they run. For example, a threat actor may use a particular malware family or possess a particular network infrastructure.

The information security community monitors threat groups and collects and shares information about their actions, the tools they use, and the industries they target. This helps the community defend against these threats more effectively.

As a result, understanding and monitoring the actions of threat actors is an important part of a cybersecurity strategy and can help organizations better protect themselves.

  

## MITRE

MITRE is a not-for-profit organization operating in the USA and this organization advises the government on many projects related to defense, national security and cyber security. MITRE has created several different frameworks for the cybersecurity community, but when it comes to the " **MITRE Framework** " the most frequently referenced framework is " **ATT&CK** ".

**MITRE ATT&CK** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a knowledge base used to identify and classify the tactics, techniques, and procedures ( **TTP ) of cyber threats. ATT&CK** helps understand what stages an attacker goes through to achieve a goal and what techniques they use in these stages.

**The ATT&CK** matrix contains many different tactics (columns) and the techniques (rows) that occur under those tactics:

  

**Tactics:** Represent the steps the attacker follows to achieve his goal. For example, initial access, execution, rights escalation, data extraction, etc.

  

**Techniques:** Specific methods used by the attacker to achieve a particular tactic. For example, using phishing emails, using a specific exploit, or communicating with command and control servers.

  

**Procedures:** Below techniques are more specific variations used by a particular threat group or software.

  

**MITRE ATT&CK** helps security teams understand how potential threats act and what techniques they use. This information is valuable for developing defense strategies, responding to incidents, and conducting threat hunting activities.

Additionally, **MITRE** continually updates **ATT&CK** to help the cybersecurity community better understand threats . Therefore, this framework is an important reference source for cybersecurity professionals.

Another important resource documented by **MITRE is Threat** They are groups.

Detailed information about current threat groups can be found in this list published at [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/ .](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/) From the same list, which techniques and tactics were used by which actor and at which stage of the attack was also documented.

This information provides security researchers around the world with a very useful road map in both incident investigation and incident response processes, and is a great way for security professionals to quickly determine what type of threat they are facing.

In this part of the training, some important concepts frequently used in cyber threat intelligence are mentioned.
