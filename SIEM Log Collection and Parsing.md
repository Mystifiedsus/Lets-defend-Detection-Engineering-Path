### Introduction to Log Collection and Parsing

In the world of information technologies, logs are records that provide valuable information about the activities of systems, applications and devices. These records contain details about when and how an event occurred. But the meaning of these raw data is often complicated without collecting and analyzing them effectively. At this point, the titles "log collection", "log analysis" and "parsing" come into play.

  

**Log Aggregation** is the process of transferring logs from multiple sources (e.g. servers, network devices, applications) to a central location. This allows organizations to access data from dispersed systems from a centralized perspective. Collection is typically accomplished using log collectors, agents or routers.

  

**Log Analysis** is the process of examining recorded log data in depth and revealing hidden information, trends and patterns in this data. This analysis is a critical tool for diagnosing performance problems in a system or application, detecting security breaches, or understanding user behavior.

  

**Parsing** is the process of transforming these collected logs into meaningful and questionable information. Raw log data often comes as long strings of text whose meaning is complex to humans. Parsing allows us to segment this complex data and identify specific events, states or values. For example, we may extract an IP address or a username from raw log data.

  

Log collection, analysis and parsing are critical in many areas, from security notifications to performance monitoring, from error detection to regulatory compliance. These processes help organizations both understand the current situation and anticipate future risks.

  

In this part of the training, the subject of log collection and parsing was introduced. In the next part of the training, the subject of “ **Determining Log Sources** ” is explained.

### Determining Log Sources

The effective functioning of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions depends on identifying the correct log sources and collecting data from these sources. Different log sources provide data in different types and formats, so identifying these sources plays a critical role in the success of the SIEM.

(Image Source: [https://layots.com/security-information-and-event-management-siem-solution-its-importance/](https://layots.com/security-information-and-event-management-siem-solution-its-importance/) )

  
  

## Why is it important?

Determining log sources is necessary for the detection and analysis of security events. Different log sources provide unique information for threat hunting and incident response processes. The importance of "Determining Log Sources":

  

  

**Comprehensive Visibility**

Identifying the right log sources allows the organization to gain comprehensive visibility over its entire network and systems. This is necessary to detect potential threats and security breaches.

  

  

**Faster Detection and Response**

SIEM solutions can detect abnormal activities and security breaches in real time. However, this depends on having accurate and complete log sources. Incomplete or incorrect log sources can extend detection times.

  

  

**Regulatory Compliance**

In many industries, organizations are required to comply with certain security standards and regulations. Identifying the right log sources plays a critical role in meeting compliance requirements.

  

  

**Data Integrity**

Data collected from accurate log sources is essential for the accuracy of analyzes and reports. Misleading, incomplete or inaccurate data can lead to incorrect security decisions.

  

  

**Optimization and Performance**

Collecting all log sources may result in unnecessary data load and cost increase. Identifying the right resources optimizes the performance of the SIEM by reducing unnecessary data traffic and storage costs.

  

  

**Strategic Planning**

Accurate log sources guide the planning and implementation of the organization's security strategy. Understanding which systems, devices, and applications are most exposed to risk helps determine where to focus resources and efforts.

  

  

As a result, "Identifying Log Sources" is a critical step that directly affects the success of SIEM solutions. This process ensures that the right foundations are laid for effective security monitoring and incident detection.

  

## Important Log Sources

SIEM is a critical tool for detecting, analyzing and responding to an organization's security threats. For SIEM to work successfully, it is essential to collect data from the correct log sources. Important log sources include network devices (router, switch, firewall, etc.), servers and operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, Unix), applications (web servers, databases, e-mail servers), security solutions (antivirus software, IDS/ IPS systems) and IoT devices (cameras, sensors). Logs from these sources allow the SIEM to detect abnormal or suspicious activity in real time, so security breaches can be quickly detected and responded to.

  

Below is a summary table of important log sources: 

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/2/log-table.png)

  
  

This table provides a summary of the different log sources that can be considered in SIEM solutions. However, since every organization's needs and infrastructure are different, you can expand or customize this list to suit your specific needs.

  

In this part of the training, determining log sources, the importance of determining log sources and important log sources are mentioned. In the next part of the training, the subject of “ **Log Collection Methods** ” is explained.

### Log Collection Methods

A SIEM system collects log information from various devices and systems to detect, analyze and respond to security threats. Effective collection of these logs is the basis of security analysis and incident response. Common log collection methods include:

  

## Collecting Logs with Agent

Agent-based collection is a method used to collect logs in a SIEM system. In this method, a special software agent is installed on target devices, servers or applications. Agents collect log information and route it for transmission to a central SIEM system.

  

  

**Advantages**

- Agents can be customized to specific log formats or resources.
- Agents can compress and encrypt logs and transmit them to the central system more quickly and securely.
- Agents can collect logs in near real-time, allowing the SIEM system to respond faster to potential threats.

  

  

**Disadvantages**

- Agent setup and management across multiple devices can be complex.
- Agents use resources such as CPU and memory on the device on which they are installed, which may cause some performance issues.

  

  

**Application Steps**

- An appropriate agent is selected according to the type of logs to be collected, the operating system and the needs of the organization.
- The selected agent is installed on the target devices or servers.
- The agent is configured to determine which logs to collect, how often to collect them, and where to send the logs.
- The agent is constantly monitored to ensure it is working properly. Additionally, updates released for agent software should be applied regularly.

  

  

**Suggestions**

- When adopting agent-based collection method, check whether agents are updated regularly.
- Choose agents that provide encryption and compression of collected logs.
- Periodically check the resource consumption of agents and prevent performance problems.

  

## Agentless Log Collection

Agentless log collection is a method used in SIEM systems to collect log information directly without installing any software agent on the target systems. This method generally collects log information over network protocols, especially standardized protocols such as Syslog.

  

  

**Advantages**

- Management complexity is reduced because there is no agent installation, update and maintenance.
- It is possible to collect logs from many devices and systems with industry standards such as Syslog.
- Since no additional software is run on target systems, resource consumption is minimal.

  

  

**Disadvantages**

- Agentless collection may be less flexible for some specific log formats or specific needs.
- The risk of losing log information is higher in cases of network outages or heavy traffic.

  

  

**Application Steps**

- The protocol to be used for agentless collection (e.g. Syslog, SNMP) is determined.
- It is determined which devices and systems logs will be collected.
- Necessary settings are made on the target systems to route the logs to the SIEM system.
- The collected logs are transmitted to the SIEM system by filtering and compressing unnecessary information.
- The agencyless collection process is constantly monitored to detect any interruptions or problems.

  

  

**Suggestions**

- When using agentless collection, regularly check on target systems whether logs are correctly routed to the SIEM system.
- Ensure the security of the protocol used for log collection; If possible, choose encrypted channels for log transmission.
- Monitor the collection process to identify potential bottlenecks or delays that may occur during collection and take precautions.

  

## Collecting Logs with Syslog

Syslog is a standard that was originally developed on *nix-based systems and is now supported on many devices and platforms. This protocol allows network devices, servers and applications to send log information to a central log server. SIEM systems collect log information from these devices using this protocol.

  

  

**Advantages**

- Syslog is widely used because it is a standard supported on a wide range of devices and platforms.
- It has a simple structure to easily route and collect log information.
- Log information from different devices and platforms can be collected in a single center.

  

  

**Disadvantages**

- The standard Syslog protocol supports unencrypted transmission, which introduces the risk of logs being intercepted.
- Since Syslog operates over UDP, there is a risk of logs being lost due to network problems.

  

  

**Application Steps**

- A Syslog server (e.g. rsyslog, syslog-ng) is installed for a centralized log collection.
- Devices and applications sending logs are configured to route to the Syslog server.
- The format in which the logs will be sent (e.g. RFC3164, RFC5424) is determined.
- If possible, encryption is done with protocols such as TLS/SSL to transmit log information securely.
- Rules are created to filter unnecessary log information and direct important logs to specific files or systems.

  

  

**Suggestions**

- Consider using encrypted versions of Syslog (e.g. Syslog over TLS) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of log information.
- For high volumes of log traffic, opt for TCP-based Syslog transmission to prevent log loss.
- Ensure that collected logs are periodically archived and backed up.

  

## API Based Log Collection

API (Application Programming Interface)-based log collection is a method of transferring log information to the SIEM system using APIs offered by specific applications, cloud services or platforms. This method involves exchanging data in formats such as JSON and XML using HTTP/HTTPS protocols, usually via web APIs.

  

  

**Advantages**

- Thanks to APIs, it offers the opportunity to collect customized log information from different sources.
- Encrypted transmission over secure protocols such as HTTPS is supported.
- Modern cloud services deliver log information through APIs.

  

  

**Disadvantages**

- Some APIs limit the maximum number of logs that can be retrieved per second per request.
- In situations with heavy log traffic, API requests can be costly.

  

  

**Application Steps**

- Obtain API keys from the service from which you want to collect log information.
- Review the API documentation to learn which endpoints to use and the required parameters.
- Query log information at specific time intervals or specific events using relevant API endpoints.
- The received log information is converted into a format that the SIEM system can understand (e.g. JSON to a native format).
- The converted log information is transferred to the SIEM system and relevant analysis and alarming operations are performed.

  

  

**Suggestions**

- When making API requests, make regular and balanced queries, taking into account service outages and speed limitations.
- Protect your API security keys and change them regularly.
- Prevent data loss in case of possible disruptions by temporarily storing the received log information with caching or intermediate storage methods.

### IBM QRadar - Firewall Log Collection

In order to receive firewall logs to QRadar, logs are sent to QRadar by defining syslog on the firewall device. QRadar will collect these logs by default. QRadar IP Address must be defined as the target IP address of the syslog definition on the firewall device, and UDP 514 must be defined as the target port.

  

For example, syslog can be defined on pfSense Firewall as follows.

Syslog can be defined via pfSense -> Status -> System Logs -> Settings -> “Remote Logging Options” screen.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/4/image3-1.png)

  
  

You can view the firewall logs sent on QRadar via the QRadar -> Admin -> Data Sources -> Log Sources screen.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/4/image3-2.png)

  
  

Collected logs are filtered by pressing the “Add Filter” button on the Qradar -> Log Activity screen and pfSense events are filtered and displayed on the “Log Activity” screen.

  

The filter to be written is selected from the “Log Source [indexed]” section and “Netgate pfSense” is selected and the “Add Filter” button is pressed.

### Log Analysis and Parsing

Log analysis and parsing have become an important need faced by information technology professionals in today's IT world. Logs contain records from computer systems, networks and applications, and are used for many purposes such as reviewing these records, debugging, detecting security threats and monitoring system performance. Experts in this field need special skills and tools to understand, analyze logs, and extract meaningful information from them.

  

Additionally, Log Analysis and Parsing is of critical importance for SIEM projects. Log analysis and parsing increases the functionality of SIEM solutions because it makes data more meaningful and actionable. Effectively analyzing logs helps detect potential security breaches faster, evaluate incidents more accurately, and help the security team respond to incidents faster. Additionally, log analysis and parsing play a critical role in meeting data management and compliance requirements in SIEM projects, as many regulatory agencies mandate regular monitoring and preservation of log records. Therefore, log analysis and parsing are indispensable for the success of security-focused SIEM projects.

  

## Log Analysis Fundamentals

Log analysis is the process of examining log files from various sources and extracting meaningful information from these logs. Details about log analysis:

  

**What is Log?**

Files containing log records produced by a computer or network system. Logs are used for many purposes such as recording events, debugging, monitoring and detecting security incidents.

  

**Sample Log Types**

**Operating System Logs:** Records operating system-related events, e.g. logins, shutdowns, error messages.

  

**Application Logs:** Logs produced by applications are used to monitor application behavior and errors.

  

**Security Logs:** Records security-related events and is used to detect malicious activities.

  

**Network Logs:** Logs produced by network devices and servers are used to monitor network traffic and connections.

  

**Structure of Log Files**

Log files are generally text-based and each line represents a log record. Each log record usually contains fields such as a timestamp, source, event type, and details. Log files can be in different formats, for example JSON, XML, CSV, etc.

  

Additionally, there may not be a standard or structure for keeping log data, but log files have a general structure and commonly used components.

  

  

**Timestamp:** Contains the date and time information when the log record was created. Usually a specific timestamp format is used, such as "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss".

  

  

**Source:** Indicates which system, application or device the log record comes from. This is important to determine which source the logs come from.

  

  

**Event Type or Log Level:** It refers to the type or severity level of the log record. Generally, levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL are used.

  

  

**Event Description:** Contains a detailed description of the log record. It may contain different information depending on the content of the log, for example error messages, process name, user activity, etc.

  

  

**Identity:** It may contain information indicating which user or entity created the log record. This is important for security monitoring purposes.

  

  

**IP Address or Host Name:** May contain the IP address or host name of the device on which the relevant event occurred. It is especially important for network logs.

  

  

**Additional Information:** It may contain additional information specific to the event. For example, details such as port number, protocol used, processing time can be provided as additional information.

  

  

**Event ID or Number (Event ID):** May contain a unique ID or number of the event. This is useful for tracking events and debugging.

  

  

**Log File Name or Source File:** Indicates which log file the log record comes from. It provides ease of monitoring and analysis when there are logs from more than one source.

  

  

**Log File Format:** Specifies the format of the log file. Formats such as text, JSON, XML, CSV are commonly used.

- It can collect and analyze logs from multiple sources.
- Supports security monitoring processes by generating alerts and reports.

  

  

These tools have different capabilities in collecting, analyzing, visualizing and reporting log data. The choice should be made depending on the need and requirements of the project. Factors such as security monitoring, debugging, performance monitoring, and compliance requirements play an important role in determining which log analysis tool to use.

  

## Regex

Regex (regular expressions) is a powerful tool used in text processing and searching. Regex is used to identify certain patterns and find or replace text that fits those patterns. Knowing regex is an important skill and tool in SIEM projects. SIEM processes log data from different sources to monitor and analyze security events. This log data can often be in various formats and structures.

  

Reasons explaining the importance and benefits of knowing regex in SIEM projects:

  

  

**Filtering and Extracting Log Data:** In SIEM projects, it is very important to filter log data and extract unwanted information to analyze security events. Using Regex, it becomes possible to filter specific events or data and focus only on information of interest. For example, you can select only events from a specific IP range or logs that contain a specific event type.

  

  

**Normalization:** Organizing and normalizing log data is a critical step for a SIEM system. Regex can be used to convert log data from different sources into the same structure. Especially in cases where log files are in different formats, regex ensures that the data is brought to the same standard format. This helps in accurate identification and analysis of events.

  

  

**Threat Detection:** To detect security threats, regex can be used to identify specific threat patterns or anomalies. Regex expressions are used to define certain patterns, especially to track attack attempts or malware activities. In this way, potential threats can be detected faster.

  

  

**Analysis and Reporting:** SIEM projects analyze security events in detail and create reports and present them to security experts. Using Regex, it is possible to select and analyze log data containing specific events or conditions and create detailed reports based on this data.

  

  

Regex knowledge is crucial for effectively processing log data and detecting security incidents in SIEM projects. This capability helps security professionals analyze log data quickly and accurately, improving organizations' processes for detecting and responding to vulnerabilities.

## Log Parsing

Log parsing is the process of analyzing the data in log files and converting them into meaningful information. Log files are text-based files that record events and information recorded from a computer system, network, or application. These files can often have different structures and formats and can be difficult for humans to read and understand. Log parsing organizes these log files, extracts certain data and converts it into a structured format, making it easier to analyze and monitor this data.

  

SIEM is a set of security technologies and processes used to monitor, analyze and respond to security events. SIEM collects security events and information from a variety of sources, analyzes this data, and provides alerts and reports to security professionals.

  

The relationship between log parsing and SIEM can be explained as follows:

  

  

**Collection of Log Data:** SIEM collects log data from different sources. This log data can often be in different formats and structures.

  

  

**Log Parsing:** The collected log data is passed through the log parsing process. At this stage, the data in the log files are analyzed, parsed and structured. It is especially important to convert the data into a consistent format and clean up unnecessary information.

  

  

**Extraction of Meaningful Information:** The log parsing process allows the extraction of meaningful information from log data. For example, it is possible to extract critical information such as IP addresses, user IDs, event types, date-time information from a log record.

  

  

**Log Analysis:** The data obtained as a result of log parsing is analyzed by the SIEM system. During this phase, security incidents and threats are detected, patterns and anomalies are looked for, and notifications are sent to security experts.

  

  

Below you can see an example that extracts IP addresses and accessed URLs from a log file using the Linux command line using the grep command and regex.

  

Sample logs to be parsed:

                    `192.168.1.100 - - [21/Sep/2023:14:30:45 +0300] "GET /page1.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 192.168.1.101 - - [21/Sep/2023:14:31:12 +0300] "GET /page2.html HTTP/1.1" 404 567 192.168.1.102 - - [21/Sep/2023:14:32:05 +0300] "GET /page1.html HTTP/1.1" 200 987`

                    `# Using grep and regex to extract IP addresses grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" access.log  # Using grep and regex to extract accessed URLs grep -oE '"GET [^"]+"' example.log | cut -d' ' -f2`

As a result, log parsing is a key component of SIEM projects because SIEM uses log data to monitor and analyze security events. Log parsing allows this data to be processed and made meaningful so that security incidents can be detected and responded to more effectively.

### Log Parsing with IBM QRadar

In cases where data is transmitted to QRadar but not parsed by QRadar or when more advanced parsers are needed, new parsers can be written using “DSM Editor”.

  

For example, let's start with Suricata events, which we know as Network IDS, transmitted to QRadar. We can see the sent events on the "Log Activity" screen, but the "Log Source" section appears as "SIM Generic Log" and the "Low Level Category" section appears as "Stored". This situation; This means that QRadar collects the logs but cannot parse them.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-5.png)

  
  

For the parsing process, one of these logs is selected and the Actions -> DSM Editor section opens.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-6.png)

  
  

On the screen that opens, the relevant log source, if any, is selected from the "Select Log Source Type" section, otherwise a new one is created by clicking "Create New".

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-7.png)

  
  

On the screen that opens, you can see that the relevant event cannot be parsed.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-8.png)

  
  

To start the parsing process, first determine the “Event ID”. To do this, Event ID is selected from the “Properties” section and a specific section within the log is selected to ensure that all events coming from the relevant source are parsed with this parser.

  

**By** typing: “suricata\[\d+\]\:” in the Expression section, the unique value in the log is filtered and all future suricata events are included in this parcel. In other words, since there is a special character after the suricata expression, the square brackets are preceded by an escape sign followed by decimal values, so the regex is defined by closing the square brackets and specifying the next ":" value with an escape character.

**Format String** : The expression to be written to the Event ID field is written.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-9.png)

  
  

The subsequent logs are mapped either to an existing event or by creating a new QID. A new Event ID is created by pressing the + button on the “Event Mappings” screen.

  

Event ID and Event Category values are determined and “Choose QID...” is selected to determine the QID.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-10.png)

  
  

A new QID value is created by selecting “Create New QID Record” on the screen that opens.

  

**Name** : QID Name

  

**Log Source Type** : Log source type is selected.

High Level Category and Low Level Category options are selected.

**Severity** : Level is determined.

It is saved with the Save button.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-11.png)

  
  

The created QID name and QID value are checked and the OK button is pressed.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-12.png)

  
  

On the screen that opens, the values are checked and the mapping is created by pressing the "Create" button.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-13.png)

  
  

Next, parse the fields in the log. Available fields are available on the Properties screen. If we are going to assign it to an existing field, we can directly select that field or recreate it if it does not exist. For example, since there is no field name for the Alert Category in the Suricata log, we create a new one.

  

Properties -> + button is pressed.

  

Alert Name, Field Type and Description fields are filled in.

  

**Enable for use in Rules, Forwarding Profiles and Search Indexing** : Select and press the "Save" button in order to search for the relevant field.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-14.png)

  
  

From the Properties section, the newly added "Alert Category" property is selected and parsing is performed with regex in the Expression section.

  

To read the Classification value in the log:

  

A regex is written as \[Classification\:\s+(.*?)\] Here, the Classification expression is “:” after the [ character and “\s+” for space.

(.*?)\] is the value up to the square brackets to be taken.

  

**Note** : The places in parentheses are the part that is extracted/extracted from the parsed data.

  

As seen below, the “Potentially Bad Traffic” part is parsed.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-15.png)

  
  

For Source IP, which is one of the existing Properties, "Source IP" is selected from the Properties section and the relevant regex is written by selecting "Overwrite system behavior". $1 allows writing the extracted data in the log to the relevant field.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-16.png)

  
  

For Destination IP, which is one of the existing Properties, "Destination IP" is selected from the Properties section and the relevant regex is written by selecting "Overwrite system behavior". $1 allows writing the extracted data in the log to the relevant field.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-17.png)

  
  

Similarly, parsing is applied and saved in the same way for the “Source Port” and “Destination Port” options.

  

You can see that the incoming logs are parsed by going to the Log Activity screen and filtering the relevant source as Log Source.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-18.png)

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SIEM+Log+Collection+and+Parsing/8/image4-19.png)

  
  

Parsing can be done this way with QRadar. With this method, log sources that are not parsed by QRadar are parsed, making it possible to write more meaningful analyzes and rules/correlations.

  

In this part of the training, how to perform log parsing with IBM QRadar is mentioned.
