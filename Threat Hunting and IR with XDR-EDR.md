### What is Threat Hunting?

## What is Threat Hunting?

Threat hunting is a security approach that is carried out proactively, not in response to security incidents, but to identify, isolate and prevent these incidents ahead of time. The goal is to actively investigate these threats, assuming they may have infiltrated the organization's network. This is done by analyzing many data sources such as network traffic, log files and endpoint data. The concept of threat hunting has the following features.

  

**Proactive Approach**

Cyber threat hunting actively searches for potential threats rather than waiting to identify them.

  

**In-Depth Data Analysis**

Hunters deeply examine data from log files, network traffic, and other data sources.

  

**Use of Specialized Tools and Techniques**

Threat hunters often use specialized tools and techniques beyond standard security tools to better detect threats.

  

**Human-Focused**

While automated security tools can assist in this process, cyber threat hunting relies heavily on the analytical capabilities of experienced security professionals.

  

## Why is Cyber Threat Hunting Necessary?

Cyber threats are constantly evolving and attackers keep developing new infiltration techniques. While traditional security tools work based on known threat signatures, cyber threat hunting uses analytical and heuristic approaches to detect attacks that have not yet been “signatured” or are customized. This better protects organizations against advanced persistent threats (APTs) and unknown threats such as zero-day attacks.

Traditional security solutions are effective at detecting known threats, but in the ever-changing and evolving cyber threat landscape, this is only the first step. Here are some key reasons why cyber threat hunting is so essential:

  

**Evolving Threat Landscape**

Cyber attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass traditional security solutions. This is mainly achieved through zero-day infiltration methods, advanced persistent threats (APTs) and specialized malware.

  

**Proactive Approach**

Traditional security tools have a reactive approach; They react when a threat is detected. However, threat hunting aims to actively find threats before they have an impact.

  

**Comprehensive Visibility**

Threat hunting often includes techniques such as in-depth network analysis, endpoint monitoring and log analysis. This helps organizations monitor every corner of their IT infrastructure.

  

**Closing Gaps**

The ability to find threats that traditional security tools cannot detect. It helps closing security gaps.

  

**Human Factor**

Cyber threat hunting relies on the analytical and problem-solving abilities of experienced security professionals that go beyond automated tools and alerts. The human factor is critical for detecting certain patterns of behavior that computers may miss.

  

**Reduction of the Damage**

An active hunting approach can significantly reduce how long attackers operate on a network (dwell time). This means reducing potential damage and cost as well.

  

**Risk Management**

Active threat hunting helps organizations better understand and manage their risks. This provides more effective protection of their most valuable assets against threats.

  

Ultimately, cyber threat hunting is a critical process that complements traditional security approaches and protects organizations against unknown and ever-changing threat landscape. This is especially important today, when the cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving and attackers are using more sophisticated and targeted attack methods.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered what threat hunting is, the features of threat hunting, and why cyber threat hunting is necessary in today’s world. In the next part of our training, we will learn abou the " **Purposes and Methods of Threat Hunting** " topic.

### Purpose and Methods of Threat Hunting

Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity approach and was developed not as a reaction to a specific security incident, but to detect and respond to such incidents in advance. Threat hunting actively investigates computing networks and systems to detect, analyze, and take action against potentially dangerous and suspicious activities.

  

## Purposes of Threat Hunting

**Proactive Defense**

Traditional security approaches are generally reactive, meaning they take action after a security breach occurs. The primary goal of threat hunting is to adopt a proactive defensive posture in which threats are detected and blocked. By actively searching for potential threats in systems and networks, it ensures that these threats are detected and blocked before they turn into real harm.

  

**Reducing Attacker's Residence Time**

Attackers usually have a residence time after taking over a network or system. During this time, they may engage in data theft, spreading malware, or other malicious activities. By reducing this dwell time, threat hunting limits attackers' activities and minimizes potential damage.

  

**Protection Against Advanced Threats**

Today's threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated to bypass traditional security tools and solutions. Threat hunting actively scans computing networks and systems to detect specialized and targeted threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

  

**Security Posture Improvement**

Threat hunting helps security teams identify vulnerabilities and potential risks in their networks. This information can be used to create a more robust security architecture and strengthen existing security protocols.

  

In summary, threat hunting helps organizations take a proactive security approach. This approach ensures that attackers are detected early and dealt with effectively, preventing potential harm and minimizing security risks.

## Methods of Threat Hunting

**Hypothesis-Based Hunting**

This approach is a method in which security experts develop a hypothesis on a particular threat or suspicion of malicious activity. For example, if an expert suspects that a particular type of malware may have infiltrated the company network, he or she initiates an in-depth investigation into that hypothesis.

  

**Machine Learning and Analytics Hunting**

**I** n this approach, a baseline is created on the normal network traffic and user behavior. Anomaly hunting detects deviations or anomalies from this norm. These deviations may be indicative of a threat or malicious activity.

  

**Signature-Based Hunting**

This approach uses signatures of pre-defined malicious activities or malware samples. Malicious activities have certain “signatures” and this method aims to find potential threats by detecting these signatures.

  

**TTP Based Hunting (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**

It is carried out based on the tactics, techniques and procedures used by attackers. CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) reports and other intelligence sources help hunters understand what types of TTPs attackers are using.

  

**Automation and Triage**

Making an initial assessment of suspicious events using tools configured for automatic threat detection.

  

Each of these methods focuses on a different aspect of threat hunting. For example, hypothesis-based hunting is often used in situations where a hunter has a specific idea or intuition about a specific threat vector or tactic, while analytical hunting is often used to analyze large amounts of data and detect specific behavioral patterns or anomalies.

  

In this part of the training, we have covered the purposes and methods of threat hunting. In the next part of our training, we will learn about the “ **Threat Hunting Techniques with EDR/XDR** ” topic.

### Threat Hunting Techniques with EDR/XDR

Even though EDR/XDR tools are the most important resources for threat hunting process and they may not be enough to achieve the goal because it requires many other resources. Other tools and technologies required for threat hunting are SIEM, XDR/EDR, CTI, network-based threat detection technologies (NIDS, NDR, etc.) and Sandboxes.

  

## Threat Hunting Techniques with EDR/XDR

EDR and XDR technologies are invaluable tools to support threat hunting activities. Thanks to these technologies, security professionals can proactively investigate and respond to potential threats. The main hunting techniques are as follows:

  

**Indicator-based Hunting**

Indicator-based Hunting is a threat hunting method that detects potential threats using previously known markers or indicators of malicious activity. These indicators are generally obtained from previously detected events, public sources, private intelligence sources or sector-specific shares.

For example; A security report states that a malicious botnet was controlled from a specific IP address. This will help cybersecurity analysts to search for this IP address in their organization's network traffic to check whether there is any interaction with those IPs and to be on the alert.

  

**Behavioral-based Hunting**

Behavioral-based Hunting is a proactive threat hunting approach that detects potential threats by monitoring typical behavior of systems, users, or networks, rather than relying on static indicators of known malicious activity. This method is based on predefined behavioral characteristics and analytics.

  

For example; Such as a user without administrative rights unexpectedly running administrative tools on the system, or a standard user running "PowerShell" or "Command Prompt" with administrative rights.

  

**Heuristic Hunting**

Heuristic Hunting is a threat hunting method that uses general behavioral characteristics and rules to detect potential threats without relying on specific threat signatures or known behaviors. This approach is often used to detect new and unknown threats.

For example; You see a constant and rapid port scanning activity on your network which is like a device on your internal network  scanning thousands of ports in a few seconds.

  

## Threat Hunting with SentinelOne

SentinelOne offers numerous features for threat hunting. One of the major characteristics of SentinelOne is that the wide range of telemetry data it collects. Using SentinelOne's “Deep Visibility” feature, you can query all activity associated with a specific IP address, domain, URL or hash value.

To perform threat hunting with SentinelOne, the "Hunting" menu opens on the "Visibility" screen.

- By opening more than one new tab on this screen, you can run different hunting queries in different tabs.
- By default, threat hunting data is kept for 14 days in SentinelOne.
- You can access ready-made queries (basic, advanced, etc.) on this screen.

You can type your query in its search bar labeled as "Start Hunting" which has the autocomplete feature. You can specify a field name or value etc. Similar field names and values to yours will automatically be listed at the bottom as you type. For example, if we are going to search for an event type, we can press the "TAB" key to list the event types we can search down.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Threat+Hunting+and+IR+with+XDR-EDR/3/image3-3.png)

  
  

Additionally, SentinelOne displays all the data collected on the hunting screen in different tabs according to certain categories. The main ones are Processes, Cross Process, Indicators, Files, Network Actions, DNS, URL, Registry, Scheduled Tasks, Logins, Driver Load, Command Scripts.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Threat+Hunting+and+IR+with+XDR-EDR/3/image3-4.png)

  
  

The "Indicators" tab in the "Hunting" section of SentinelOne can be thought of as a tool that allows you to investigate specific threat indicators and identify potential threats on your systems based on these indicators. This tab is used to search and analyze signs of malicious activity. This is a proactive security approach which scans your network based on known signs of malware and helps you identify potential threats.

For example, when we look at the Indicator detail below, it is reported that the "cmd.exe" opened by the "admin" user was run via a shortcut, not as a direct incident, but as a potential suspicious activity. This situation points to the Mitre T1204 technique.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Threat+Hunting+and+IR+with+XDR-EDR/3/image3-5.png)

  
  

When we look at another Indicator detail, we see that the case reported as “Different Original Filename” was actually run by the “C:\python27\excel.exe” application, which imitates excel.exe, one of the Microsoft Office applications, but this exe was reported because it is not the original Excel application.

## How to Relate EDR/XDR to Incident Response?

**Early Threat Detection**

EDR and XDR technologies continuously monitor organizations' networks, endpoints and cloud infrastructures. In this way, abnormal or unusual behavior, malware or signs of threats can be detected quickly. This early detection allows attacks to be addressed in their early stages and helps limit potential damage.

  

**Rapid Response Capacity**

EDR/XDR technologies are equipped with automation and fast response mechanisms. In this way, when a threat is detected, automatic response mechanisms can involve to take action. For example, when a malicious file is detected, responses such as quarantining this file or isolating the system from the network access can be carried out automatically. This rapid response helps prevent the spread of attacks and minimize their impact.

  

**Detailed Analysis and Diagnosis**

EDR and XDR technologies have the capacity to analyze attacks in detail. These analyses may include details such as how the attack occurred, what steps were followed, and which systems were affected. These analyses are critical to better understand the causes and consequences of the event.

  

**Identifying the Chain of Events**

EDR/XDR technologies can detect how attacks occur step by step. This is important to determine the attack chain and understand what stages the attack went through. This information helps develop strategies to predict and prevent similar attacks in the future.

  

**Provide Visibility**

While EDR technologies monitors activities at endpoints, XDR can also monitor network and cloud-based activities. This holistic visibility is critical for detecting and blocking threats across platforms. Thanks to the integration of data from different sources, the entire threat can be better understood.

  

**Automation and Efficiency**

EDR/XDR technologies reduce human error and speed up the response process thanks to their automation capabilities. Tasks that people must implement manually are automated, so response times are faster and teams can work more efficiently.

  

**Data Collection and Storage**

EDR/XDR solutions can store data collected during the attack for analysis and use when necessary. This data is important for analyzing the attack, determining the source of the threat and preventing attacks. It can also be used to extract lessons learned to improve future incident response processes.

  

**Learning and Improvement**

The use of EDR/XDR technologies provides an opportunity to learn from experiences gained from real attacks and incidents. These experiences help improve future incident response processes. Improvement opportunities are identified and security defenses are strengthened.

  

**Integration of Various Data Sources**

XDR provides more comprehensive visibility by integrating different data sources. This makes it easier to evaluate and detect attacks from different perspectives.

  

**Data Based Decision Making**

EDR/XDR tools deliver data-driven analysis and reports, enabling teams to make better decisions. Thanks to decision-making based on this data, more effective strategies are developed.

  

In conclusion, EDR and XDR technologies strengthen the organization’s security defenses, helping them responding to cyber attacks faster, detect threats more effectively, and be ready for future attacks. These technologies make the Incident Response process more effective and efficient.
