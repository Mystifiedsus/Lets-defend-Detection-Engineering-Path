### What is TheHive?

In this lesson, we will see practical scenarios regarding the installation, configuration and use of the SOAR product. At this stage, we will use TheHive, which, although open source, does not lag behind its commercial competitors in terms of functionality, stability and speed. The most important reason for this is that you may experience problems when downloading and installing commercial products for testing.

  

## What is TheHive?

TheHive is an open-source security incident response and information management (SOAR/SIEM) platform that serves as a security operations center (SOC) for organizations. It is designed to help security teams automate and manage incident response, threat intelligence and security operations.

## TheHive Basis Features

**Incident Response**

TheHive can automatically detect, classify and respond to incidents. This can help security teams reduce incident response time and resolve incidents more efficiently. TheHive can automatically detect incidents using data from firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint security solutions. It can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to determine the importance and priority of events. It can automatically task incident response teams with tasks that help resolve incidents quickly and effectively.

  

  

**Threat Intelligence**

TheHive4 can be used to collect, analyze and distribute threat intelligence. This can help security teams better understand threats and respond more effectively. It can automatically collect threat intelligence from various sources. It can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze the threat intelligence it collects and turn it into meaningful information. Can distribute threat intelligence to security teams and stakeholders.

  

  

**Security Operations**

Offers a variety of tools and features to help security teams manage security operations. It can help security teams work more efficiently and prevent threats more proactively.

  

  

**Integration Capabilities**

TheHive4 can be integrated with a variety of security tools and systems. It can be integrated with firewalls, IPS systems, SIEM products and TI resources within the organization to both receive data and take action.

  

  

Hive has a great API where you can do everything you do in the interface programmatically, so your integration and automation options are nearly endless. But the conveniences don't end there. Thanks to the python library called TheHive4py distributed by its developers, you can send direct queries to thehive4 API and receive responses using just an API key.

  

While TheHive does all this, there is a second application it works with: Cortex.

(The Cortex we're talking about here should not be confused with PaloAlto's Cortex.)

  

## Cortex

Cortex is literally the brains of TheHive. While TheHive focuses on processes, cortex handles tasks that require automation in the background, such as observable analysis and active response.

### TheHive4py

TheHive4py is TheHive's official python library and is an excellent tool for talking to TheHive API.

The Hive4Py provides greatly streamlined functions for talking to the TheHive Rest API, using the Python Requests library. Thanks to these, you can do everything you can do in the interface in TheHive programmatically with Python codes.

  

- Administrator Functions
- Alert Functions
- Case Functions
- Observables Functions
- Task Functions

  

These are functions you can access from within Python.

  

For example, with the following simple code snippet, you can list alarms in TheHive with TLP Value AMBER, Severity High and Title containing “MALSPAM” in JSON format:

                    `import json from thehive4py.api import TheHiveApi from thehive4py.models import * from thehive4py.query import *  THEHIVE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:9000' THEHIVE_API_KEY = '**YOUR_API_KEY**'  api = TheHiveApi(THEHIVE_URL, THEHIVE_API_KEY)  query = And(     Eq('tlp', Tlp.AMBER.value),     Eq('severity', Severity.HIGH.value),     Like('title', '*MALSPAM*') ) response = api.find_alerts(query=query)  # Print the JSON response  print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4, sort_keys=True))`
                  CopyCopy

You can access the documents of this library at the following address:

  

[https://thehive-project.github.io/TheHive4py/](https://thehive-project.github.io/TheHive4py/)

  

In this part of the training, TheHive4py library and its use are mentioned. The next part of the tutorial explains “ **About TheHive Installation ”.**

### Questions Progress

### TheHive Installation

TheHive, like almost all open source products, can be installed and run in a variety of ways.

[https://docs.thehive-project.org/thehive/installation-and-configuration/installation/step-by-step-guide/](https://docs.thehive-project.org/thehive/installation-and-configuration/installation/step-by-step-guide/) and click on the “TheHive 4” link at the top of the menu, you can follow the step by step installation steps for both RedHat and You can find the instructions needed to install it on Debian-based Linux systems.

  

However, there are some decisions you need to make before starting such an installation, because TheHive is designed very modularly to meet different needs and to be easily integrated into your environment.

  

## System Resource

The first detail we need to decide on will be the CPU and RAM. A user-by-user table for this is given in TheHive's documentation:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/3/soar8.png)

  
  

We have to say that these values are minimum values. Therefore, we will work with 4 CPUs and 8 RAM.

  

## Database

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/3/soar7.png)

  
  

In the next step, Database selection awaits us. Here we have two options: **BerkeleyDB** and **Apache Cassandra .** There will not be too much load, testing etc. While BerkeleyDB is a very sufficient and lightweight system for environments, Apache Cassandra will be the right choice for production environments where a significant amount of data will be processed.

  

## File System

In the next step we will need to select our file system. Here, our options are **Local File System, NFS Folder, Apache Hadoop, S3 Compatible** .

  

Local File System, as its name suggests, is the file system of the operating system on which we will install TheHive and can be used as ext4, xfs, etc. Any scheme can be used. This option is again suitable for small operations, test environments, etc. However, it is prone to problems in issues such as High Availability and Flexibility.

  

  

**NFS Folder** is a method that you can use without any hassle, especially when you want to use remote disks on the network.

  

  

**Apache Hadoop** is an open source framework designed for places where BigData exists. Hadoop allows processing large data sets in a distributed manner using a programming model called MapReduce. MapReduce works by splitting a dataset into small pieces, processing those pieces across multiple nodes, and combining the results. As you will have understood, it is an important option for processing, storing and using huge amounts of data.

  

**S3 Compatible** , Amazon S3 Bucket etc. It is the option where you can use S3 compatible cloud services as a file system. 

  

## Index System

And now we have only one decision left to make. Which system will we use to index the data? Here we also have Apache Lucene and ElasticSearch options. Apache Lucene is a very sufficient option for Standalone installations where we will not create a distributed structure. If we need larger and more complex structures, it would be appropriate to consider the ElasticSearch option.

  

Our recommendations for the test system will be **Local File System** , **Apache Cassandra** , **ElasticSearch** search trio, and we will proceed using these options in the rest of the lesson. Let us add the information that whichever options we choose will not change anything in terms of the functionality of TheHive.

  

Finally, in order to eliminate compatibility problems in different operating systems and different Linux distributions and to turn our main focus to the features of the product, we will install with docker and share our docker-compose.yml file with you.

  

Also, let us remind you that the installation we will do here is a test environment and we do not recommend it for a production environment.

  

In this part of the training, some points to know about TheHive installation are mentioned. The next part of the tutorial covers “ **Installing Linux for TheHive ”.**

### Questions Progress

### Linux Installation for TheHive

We will install Rocky Linux 8.8 together. You can download the installation media from [https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/isos/x86_64/Rocky-8.8-x86_64-minimal.iso](https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/isos/x86_64/Rocky-8.8-x86_64-minimal.iso) . If we are going to do a baremetal installation, you will need to write the ISO image to a USB disk and boot your machine with it. If you are going to use a virtualization environment, it will be enough to present this iso file as the Boot media.

  

As we talked about above under the “System Resource” heading, we provided 4 CPUs and 8GB RAM.

Regarding the hard disk, 20GB will be enough for the test environment, that's what we did.

  

If your virtualization environment cannot decide which operating system the image is, you can proceed by choosing **Linux** , or if it cannot decide which Linux distribution it is, **Redhat 8** .

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar9.png)

  
  

When we start the machine, the boot menu will greet us and we will see a countdown timer. If we wait for this timer, the “Test this media & install Rocky Linux 8.8” option will run and it will check the integrity of your iso file before starting the installation. Since we were sure of our iso file, we proceeded with the “Install Rocky Linux 8.8” option. (If you downloaded the iso file for the first time, did not check the hash values after downloading, or moved it from one place to another on your computer/network, we do not recommend skipping the test mode.)

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar10.png)

  
  

After a while, we will be greeted by the screen on the left below. We leave the installation language in English and proceed by pressing button **1 and come to the screen on the right.**

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar11.png)

  
  

On this screen, we click on button **2** and see the disk configuration screen on the left below. By pressing button 3 twice on this screen, we accept the default disk configuration.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar12.png)

  
  

This time we select **“Network & Host Name” from the options.** On the screen that appears, we write the host name of our system in field **4 (we did thehive-test** , you can do the same too) and make this change valid by clicking on button **5 .** Finally, by clicking button number **6** , we open the network card of our system and enable it to connect to the network by obtaining the IP address. If this is not the case, we return to the main menu by clicking the “ **Done ” button** in the upper left corner .

Now it's almost over, this time in the main menu, we scroll down a little and click on the " **Create User** " option and we are greeted by the screen on the left below.

  

**Make this user Administrator** ” option at the bottom of the username and click on the “Done” Button in the upper **left** corner . If there is a policy conflict with the password we chose, if the password is not complex enough, etc. in cases **!** We receive a warning in the area we indicate with , but if we do not want to make any changes, we can return to **the Main Menu by clicking the " Done** " button again . Now all we have to do is click on the " **Begin Installation** " button (in the lower right corner) and get ourselves some coffee.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar13.png)

  
  

When the installation is completed, we complete the installation by clicking the “ **Reboot System** ” button in the lower right corner. Our system automatically restarts and we are presented with the following screen:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar14.png)

  
  

We now have a working operating system, but first we need to bring it up to date.

To do this, after logging in with the username and password we created during the installation.

We get updates with the **sudo dnf update command.** After this command, when you are asked for confirmation for the updates to be installed, simply press **Y** and then press Enter.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar15.png)

  
  

After completing the updates, we can move on to installing the docker environment.

For installation, we first need to add the docker repo to our operating system:

                    `sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

Afterwards, we can start installing the docker engine and other packages we will need:

                    `sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar16.png)

  
  

After the installation is completed, we set the docker service to run automatically at system startup:

                    `sudo systemctl enable docker`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

Then we run the docker service:

                    `sudo systemctl start docker`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

Then we check if everything is OK:

                    `sudo systemctl status docker`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

If everything is OK, we should see **Active (Running) , as we see in the screenshot below** :

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar17.png)

  
  

Now, the next step is to add ourselves to the docker group:

                    `sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

Finally, we end our session with **the logout** command and log in again.

  

## TheHive Docker

Now you can copy our “docker-compose.yml” file that we configured for TheHive:

                    `version: "3.8" Services:    nginx:     container_name: nginx     hostname: nginx     image: nginx:1.19.5     ports:       - 80:80       - 443:443     networks:       - proxy     volumes:       - ./vol/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d       - ./vol/ssl:/etc/ssl       - ./vol/nginx-logs:/var/log/nginx     restart: on-failure    cassandra:     container_name: cassandra     image: cassandra:3.11     restart: unless-stopped     hostname: cassandra     environment:       - MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1G       - HEAP_NEWSIZE=1G       - CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME=thp     volumes:       - ./vol/cassandra/data:/var/lib/cassandra/data     networks:       - backend    elasticsearch:     container_name: elasticsearch     image: elasticsearch:7.11.1     environment:       - http.host=0.0.0.0       - discovery.type=single-node       - cluster.name=hive       - script.allowed_types= inline       - thread_pool.search.queue_size=100000       - thread_pool.write.queue_size=10000       - gateway.recover_after_nodes=1       - xpack.security.enabled=false       - bootstrap.memory_lock=true       - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx256m     ulimits:       nofile:         soft: 65536         hard: 65536     volumes:       - ./vol/elasticsearch/data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data       - ./vol/elasticsearch/logs:/usr/share/elasticsearch/logs     networks:       - backend    thehive:     container_name: thehive     image: 'thehiveproject/thehive4:latest'     restart: unless-stopped     depends_on:       - cassandra     ports:       - '0.0.0.0:9000:9000'     volumes:       - ./vol/thehive/application.conf:/etc/thehive/application.conf       - ./vol/thehive/data:/opt/thp/thehive/data       - ./vol/thehive/index:/opt/thp/thehive/index     command:       --cortex-port 9001       --cortex-keys ${CORTEX_KEY}     networks:       - proxy       - backend    cortex:     container_name: cortex     image: thehiveproject/cortex:latest     depends_on:       - elasticsearch     networks:       - proxy       - backend     command:       --job-directory ${JOB_DIRECTORY}     environment:       - 'JOB_DIRECTORY=${JOB_DIRECTORY}'     volumes:       - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock'       - '${JOB_DIRECTORY}:${JOB_DIRECTORY}'  networks:   backend:   proxy:     external: true`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

You will need to go back to the system we installed and save the above content to a file named “docker-compose.yml”. You can use editors such as **vi and nano** for this . We won't go into detail about these in this lesson, but if you don't know how to do it or don't remember it, this is a great time to remember the relevant lessons.

  

In the next step, we need to create a file named **.env in which we will define the API key for cortex to communicate with thehive and define cortex's job directory: (the . at the beginning of the file name** is important)

                    `CORTEX_KEY=123456 JOB_DIRECTORY=/opt/cortex/jobs`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

**.env** file and exit.

In our config file, you see 5 service definitions: Nginx, Cassandra, Elasticsearch Thehive and Cortex. Again, if you examine our config file carefully, you will see some storage mapping definitions. In order for these to work, we need to create a directory named **vol in the directory where we saved the “docker-compose.yml” file:**

                    `mkdir vol`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

Those of you who looked more carefully may have noticed that we also added an nginx service, although we never mentioned it before. In fact, it is possible to run TheHive without Nginx, but TheHive and Cortex's web interfaces do not support SSL/TLS. To provide this support, we will use Nginx as a reverse proxy.

                    `[thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ mkdir vol/ssl [thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ touch vol/nginx/ssl.conf [thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ touch vol/nginx/thehive.conf [thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ touch vol/nginx/cortex.conf`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

After creating the files, it's time to fill in their contents. You need to save the following contents by writing them into the relevant files:

  

**ssl.conf:**

                    `ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/nginx-crt.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/nginx-key.key;`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

**thehive.conf:**

                    `server {   listen 443 ssl;   server_name thehive-01.localhost;   proxy_connect_timeout   600;   proxy_send_timeout      600;   proxy_read_timeout      600;   send_timeout            600;   client_max_body_size    2G;   proxy_buffering off;   client_header_buffer_size 8k;    location / {     add_header              Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";     proxy_pass            http://thehive:9000;     proxy_http_version      1.1;   } }`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

**cortex.conf:**

                    `server {   listen 4443 ssl;   server_name cortex-01.localhost;    proxy_connect_timeout   600;   proxy_send_timeout      600;   proxy_read_timeout      600;   send_timeout            600;   client_max_body_size    2G;   proxy_buffering off;   client_header_buffer_size 8k;    location / {     add_header              Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";     proxy_pass            http://cortex:9001;     proxy_http_version      1.1;   } }`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

Now, we need to create SelfSigned certificates in the ssl directory we defined for nginx by running the following commands:

                    `[thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ mkdir vol/nginx/ [thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout vol/ssl/nginx-key.key -out vol/ssl/nginx-crt.crt`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

While creating the certificates, it will ask you for some information, we have filled it in our own way, you can fill it in as you wish. The information you enter will not affect the result at this stage.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar19.png)

  
  

If everything is OK, you should have an image like this in your current directory:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar20.png)

  
  

Now we are ready to start our services, just run the following commands:

                    `[thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ docker network create proxy [thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ docker compose up -d`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

On the first run, docker images will be downloaded, so this stage will take some time, we recommend you to wait patiently.

  

After the installation is finished, when you run **the docker compose ps** command, you should see an output similar to the following:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar21.png)

  
  

There is a hurdle we need to overcome to access the web interfaces of Thehive and Cortex. In the Rocky Linux 8.8 we installed, the firewall is running by default and will reject our requests to 443 (TheHive) and 4443 (Cortex) services. To allow requests to these ports, we will need to run the following commands:

                    `[thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=443/tcp --permanent [thehive-user@thehive-test ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp --permanent`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

Now that everything is ready, we can open a browser and see TheHive on the 443 (https) port of our virtual machine and Cortex on the 4443 (https) port. (Since we are using a SelfSigned certificate, we will see a certificate warning, we will have to accept it and proceed)

  

you can log in using the default username **admin@thehive.local** and default password: **secret .**

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar25.png)

  
  

On the Cortex side, the process is a little different. It will bring up a screen for us to set an administrator password, where you need to set a username and password that you will not forget.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar31.png)

  
  

Afterwards, it will take us to a screen where we can log in with the username and password we specified:

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar34.png)

  
  

Our next job, TheHive Creating the API-Key required for Cortex to work together.

Since Cortex works multi-tenancy just like TheHive, let's first define an organization for our tests and then create an api-key for this organization.

  

First, we click on **the Organizations link** in field **(1)** . Then, in area (2), we click on the **+Add Organization** link. After giving a name and a Display Name to our Organization in the **Create Organization window** that opens , we finish the process by clicking the **Save** button.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Open+Source+SOAR%3A+TheHive/4/soar24.png)

  
  

Now we will click on our organization and create not one but two users with the **+Add User button.**

One of these users will be the API User, which will allow our organization in TheHive to communicate with our organization in Cortex, and the other will be the user with whom we will do our work at the organizational level in Cortex.

  

**read and analyze** roles for API User . For our own user, we give **the read, analyze, orgAdmin** roles:

After adding both users, we create a password for the API User by clicking on **the Create API Key** button and clicking on the API Key, **New Password** button.

You will need to make a note of the Api-Key we created because we will need to enter this key in the CORTEX_KEY= section in the .env file we created before. After doing this, we need to restart TheHive Service in the console so that it can use this key.

                    `docker compose  up --build  thehive`
                  CopyCopyCopyCopy

, you should see (3) ( **OK** ) in the CORTEX section in the popup that opens.

Next up is to create an organization on TheHive. As we said at the beginning, TheHive Multi Tenancy works and allows you to manage many different organizations from a single interface. We will click on the "Add Organization" button to create an organization that we will use in the rest of our work, give a name to the organization and click "OK".

Afterwards, the newly created organization will be displayed in the "Organizations" list:

As you can see in the screenshot, we created the “LetsDefend” organization. Now it's time to add users to our organization. When we click on the "LetsDefend" organization in the list, we will go to a screen where we can manage the relevant organization and here we will see the " **+Create New User** " option in the upper left corner. We click immediately and create our user as follows. (We will create our user in the orgAdmin profile.)

After adding the user, when we return to the Users list, we will see the "Create Password" button next to the user we created. What we need to do is to click on this button and create a password that we will not forget.

  

Finally, let's log out from the admin account and log in with this new account.

  

In this part of the training, the installation of TheHive is mentioned.
