### Introduction to Network Security

Network Security is a set of measures and applications used to protect computer networks from unauthorized access, abuse, interruption, or changes. Various technologies, policies, and procedures are employed to safeguard network infrastructure, data, and resources from potential threats.

  

Let's explore the fundamentals of network security by breaking it down into the following categories:

  

**Firewalls**

The firewalls regulate and screen the flow of incoming and outgoing network traffic, blocks potential threats, and prevents unauthorized access. It can be considered one of the fundamental building blocks of network security.

  

**Access Control and Authentication** 

Verifying the identities of users and devices is crucial in controlling access to the network. You can use username/password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) as methods of authentication.

  

**Encryption** 

Encrypting data ensures that it remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. The encrypted transmission or storage of sensitive data increases data security.

  

**Network Segmentation**

Network segmentation involves logically dividing the network into distinct segments, thereby isolating traffic within these segments. This limitation on the spread of attacks enhances network security, as it narrows down the potential attack surface.

  

**Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**

IDPS detect and block attacks by monitoring network traffic. They are capable of identifying known attack types and detecting abnormal network traffic.

  

**Patch/Update Management**

Maintaining and keeping systems and software up-to-date on the network helps to address known security vulnerabilities. Regularly applying security patches and updates is crucial for ensuring network security.

  

**Network Monitoring and Logging**

Monitoring network traffic and events is essential for detecting and responding to security threats. By analyzing network logs, attacks or abnormal activities can be identified and addressed promptly.

  

**Physical Security**

It is critically important to ensure the physical security of the network infrastructure. Physical access points such as server rooms, network devices, and data centers should be protected at all times.

  

**Education and Awareness**

Educating and raising users' awareness about security is crucial. It is important to employ password policy like to encourage users to use strong passwords, or increase their awareness against phishing emails and keeping them up-to-date on how to identify those phishing emails, as well as keep the users adhere to security policies is critically important.

### Network Devices Syslog & SNMP Settings

## What is Syslog & what is it used for?

  

Syslog is a standard protocol used to record logs and events generated by an operating system or network device. Logs are records of a system's actions and their timing. This information is particularly useful for identifying problems and conducting analysis in case of errors. Furthermore, logs play a key role in detecting security breaches.

  

Syslog stands out with its ability to collect log records from multiple devices in one place. This offers a network-wide overview and facilitates the swift tracking of particular events. Its ability to collect logs from different devices and operating systems makes it a flexible log management solution.

  

Logs sent via Syslog adhere to a standardized format that includes specific details such as timestamp, source IP address, event level, and event details. Adopting this standard enables analysis and processing tools to process logs easily. For more detailed information about the standards, you can check out the "syslog rfc standards".

  

The Syslog protocol provides information about the priority and source of logs. This information is categorized into two main sections known as "facility" and "severity," respectively.

  

The facility identifies the source of the message and is usually an operating system component or a network device. You can see the general "facility" codes below.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/network-security/table-1.png)

  
  

  

Severity indicates the significance of the message. The following are the general "severity" levels:

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/network-security/table-2.png)

  
  

  

Each Syslog message is assigned a priority by combining both categories. This priority is typically displayed in the "<facility.severity>" format. For example, if a displayed message's priority appears as "<3.6>", it indicates that the system daemon (facility 3) sent an informational message (severity 6).

  

You can find the sample output about syslog settings from a Linux system below. 

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/network-security/5/image5-1.png)

  
  

  

Based on the example above, you can add the following line at the bottom of the /etc/rsyslog.conf file on a Linux (RHEL-based) system to send only security logs to the syslog server.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/network-security/5/image5-2.png)

  
  

  

In order for the relevant settings to be active, it is necessary to restart the “rsyslog” service on the linux system. 

  

  

## What is SNMP, and what is it used for?

  

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard internet protocol used for controlling and managing network devices. SNMP enables the monitoring of the status and activity of various network components, including routers, switches, servers, printers, and firewalls.

  

SNMP's main goal is to enable network administrators to monitor device status and diagnose network issues. It collects device information and allows configuration when needed. Moreover, SNMP is a crucial tool for optimizing network performance, enhancing reliability, and swiftly diagnosing network problems.

  

SNMP versions; 

  

**SNMPv1 (SNMP Version 1):** It is the first version of SNMP and offers basic network management features. Nevertheless, the security of the system is limited since the network traffic remains unencrypted. This poses a risk of potential leakage or modification of traffic information sent from/received to the network.

  

**SNMPv2 (SNMP Version 2):** This version provides performance improvements and additional features in contrast to SNMPv1. Two minor versions, v2c and v2u, exist. However, it has not gained widespread acceptance and is not in general use.

  

**SNMPv3 (SNMP Version 3):** This is the latest version of SNMP and provides major security improvements.SNMPv3 offers authorization and privacy features to encrypt network traffic, thereby reducing the risk of information being tracked or modified.

  

For example, when the corresponding SNMP settings are made on a Linux server, you can remotely obtain data from the system related to SNMP. 

  

The information retrieved from the "dockerio" server via SNMP using the "snmpwalk" command on a Linux system includes the hostname ("centosvm"), kernel version, server date, and timezone. The server's IP address is 192.168.1.100. The "snmpwalk" command has been used to obtain this data.

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/network-security/5/image5-3.png)

  
  

  

  

Information on the parameters to be used with the 'snmpwalk' command;

  

-v: SNMP version information

-c: the password set to retrieve data via SNMP.

-O: output information type, e="print enums numerically”

  

  

In this part of our training, we have covered the importance of syslog and SNMP services on the network devices, the types of outputs they generate, and how to interpret these outputs effectively.

### Network Traffic Capture & Analyze

It is a fundamental topic in network security that almost every role related to security should be familiar with. Among the basic applications used in this context are tools like Wireshark and TCPdump.

  

The most important issues to consider when capturing traffic are as follows;

  

- Whether the traffic is encrypted or not; when analyzing encrypted traffic, we cannot see the contents of outgoing/incoming packets in a clear format.
- The size of the traffic and the saved files; analyzing high-size files can be difficult when transferring these files to a different location later or capturing them with an analysis tool. 
- Performance criteria; it is important that the captured application fully captures the traffic. The situation can be monitored through the drop rate ratios on the interface.
- Meaningful data capture; As an example, if an analysis is to be performed on the web traffic, there is no need to capture all the traffic. We can capture the traffic belonging to the relevant protocol and service only.

  

Traffic capture and analysis play a crucial role in network security and management. It is essential to grasp the basics for several reasons, including:

  

**Debugging and Troubleshooting** 

Traffic capture serves as a valuable tool to identify packets and data flowing through a network, making it an invaluable resource for detecting and resolving network issues. For instance, it can be used to investigate the cause of a network connection slowdown, diagnose malfunctions in applications, or determine the reasons behind service inaccessibility.

  

**Security Analysis** 

Traffic analysis is also used to detect suspicious or malicious activities. For instance, it can help identify network intrusions by determining if an attacker has gained access, detect malware infections on devices, or recognize DDoS attacks when they occur.

  

**Performance Monitoring** 

Traffic capture and analysis are used to understand network performance and capacity. For example, they can be used to determine which applications use the most bandwidth, which services cause the most network traffic, and how overall network usage is trending.

  

**Compliance with Regulations**  

Compliance with industry standards and government regulations often necessitates monitoring and reporting specific types of network traffic. Traffic capture and analysis are utilized to ensure adherence to these regulations and standards.

  

**Identification of New Threats**  

Traffic analysis is instrumental in identifying both new and established threats. Such threats are typically detected by observing abnormal network activity or traffic that deviates from known good patterns. For instance, to create an IPS/IDS signature for a new attack vector, it is crucial to possess the knowledge and skills for traffic capture and analysis.

  

**Verifying compliance with agreements and policies** 

Organizations are typically required to adhere to certain network policies and protocols. Capturing and analyzing traffic can be used to verify that these policies and protocols are being followed.

  

**Forensic Analysis**  

When there is a security breach, traffic capture, and analysis tools are often an integral part of the investigation and response process. It is also used to understand past events and how events evolved. 

  

**Detection of Information Leakage**  

Traffic analysis is used to investigate if sensitive information is being transmitted over the network. For instance, it can help identify whether sensitive files or data are being sent to external sources through traffic monitoring and analysis.

  

**Provision of High-Quality Services**

### Network Troubleshooting

Network troubleshooting is a process used by Network and Security Engineers to detect, monitor and solve network problems. This process helps to optimize network performance and security, ensure business continuity, and minimize service interruptions. Network troubleshooting capabilities require a thorough knowledge of protocols, services, network hardware, and software. In addition, effective network troubleshooting usually involves the use of diagnostic tools such as ping, traceroute, and network analysis tools such as Wireshark, and TCPdump. Since the previous courses provided detailed information on the relevant protocol, application, and analysis tools, these topics will not be covered in this course.

  

We will explain the topic in 3 basic headings. 

  

- Most Commonly Used Network Troubleshooting Tools;
- Scenarios Requiring Network Troubleshooting;
- Examples of Network Troubleshooting

  

  

## Most Commonly Used Network Troubleshooting Tools

  

**Ping:** Ping is a tool used to test the health of a network connection. It sends and receives packets from one system to another and measures the duration of this process. It can also detect packet loss.

  

**Traceroute (tracert):** Traceroute shows how a packet gets from one point to another. It helps to determine the path a packet takes across a network.

  

**Nslookup / Dig:** These tools are used to test and resolve DNS queries. They resolve IP addresses into domain names or vice versa.

  

**Netstat:** Netstat is used to display network connections, routing tables, and network interface information. This is useful for understanding what network connections a system has.

  

**Wireshark:** Wireshark is a powerful tool used to analyze network traffic and detect network problems. It can display all network traffic and analyze packets.

  

**TCPDump:** TCPDump captures and analyzes network traffic. It usually works via the command line interface and provides detailed information about network traffic.

  

**IPerf:** IPerf is a tool used to assess the bandwidth of a network connection by measuring the data transfer rate between two systems.

  

**Nmap:** Nmap is a network discovery and security auditing tool. It detects what devices are active on the network and what services are running.

  

**Advanced IP Scanner:**   It is a free network scanning tool that quickly scans and analyzes all systems on a network.  It provides comprehensive information, including IP addresses, users, network shares, and other details, and also enables remote access and control of specific systems.

  

  

## Scenarios That Require Network Troubleshooting;

  

**Internet Connection Problems**  

If a user cannot connect to the Internet, the first step is usually to check and restart the modem and/or router. If this does not resolve the problem, a more detailed troubleshooting process may be required. This may include checking IP settings, investigating DNS issues, and/or contacting the Internet Service Provider (ISP).

  

**Slow Network Connections**  

When a network is running slowly, several tools can be used to determine the source of the problem. These include the use of network monitoring tools, which are typically used to monitor bandwidth usage, analyze network traffic, and identify systems or services that may be slowing down.

  

**Service Access Problems** 

When a user faces difficulty accessing a specific service or application, such as a website or email server, it often suggests potential issues with the network configuration or the service itself. To address such problems, it is usually necessary to review the network configuration settings, check the status of the service, and investigate any potential obstacles arising from firewalls or network policies.

  

**Network Security Issues** 

If there are signs of a security breach on the network (for example, unknown traffic, unexpected system behavior, etc.), this usually requires a more thorough troubleshooting process. This may include actions such as capturing and analyzing network traffic, examining system logs, and detecting and removing potentially malicious software.

  

  

## Examples of Network Troubleshooting

  

**Situation:** An office employee cannot access shared files in the office.

**The Solution Process:** First, we need to check the employee's network connection. We can use the “ping” command to see if the computer is connected to the network or not. If this is not the reason, we can check the file-sharing services. The problem may be caused by an incorrect configuration of the shared files or an error in the access permissions.

  

**Situation:** A web server slows down unexpectedly or stops responding.

**The Solution Process:** Initially, we assess the server for possible overload by checking the the server resources, including processor usage, RAM usage, and disk usage. If resource utilization exceeds normal levels, further analysis is essential to identify the services responsible for the excessive resource consumption or any services that need to be limited or suspended.

  

**Situation:** The Internet connection drops unexpectedly for all users.

**The Solution Process:** In this case, the first step is usually to check the network hardware. We check if there is a fault with the modem, router, or other network devices. If any part of this hardware is defective or faulty, we can consider restarting the device or replacing it if necessary. It may also be useful to check for connection problems with your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

  

**Situation:** Employees who connect to your company's VPN experience delays in accessing network resources.

**The Solution Process:** In this case, it is important to check the performance of the VPN server. If the server is overloaded, we can consider adding more resources. We also need to make sure that the VPN is configured correctly and follows the necessary security protocols. If the problem persists, we can use Wireshark or a similar tool to analyze network traffic and identify potential bottlenecks.

### Top Network Attacks & Mitigation

Network Attacks occur when individuals or groups attempt to gain unauthorized access to an organization's network systems. The objectives of these attacks typically involve data theft, system damage, or service disruption. Among the types of attacks are DDoS attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, IP spoofing, ARP spoofing, SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), phishing, malware attacks, brute force attacks, and zero-day attacks. Each of these threats poses a significant network security and privacy challenge, and an effective network security strategy requires the ability to protect against and proactively respond to these threats.

  

## DDoS Attacks (Distributed Denial of Service)

  

DDoS attacks are usually carried out using a botnet network consisting of a large number of systems and aim to consume the resources of a targeted server, service, or network and thus make the service unusable. DDoS attacks are usually of three types:

  

**Volume-Based Attacks:** These attacks are designed to consume the target's network bandwidth. UDP flood (user datagram protocol) and ICMP flood (internet control message protocol) are examples of such attacks.

  

**Protocol Attacks:** These attacks target and consume the system resources (processors, firewalls, etc.) of the target. One example of such attacks is the SYN flood (synchronization).

  

**Application Layer Attacks:** These attacks focus on a specific application of the target. An example of such attacks is HTTP flood attacks.

  

Several strategies and tools can be used to prevent DDoS attacks. These include utilizing DDoS protection services, enhancing network capacity, implementing proper network configurations, and continuously monitoring traffic behavior. However, it is crucial to treat DDoS attacks seriously and offer appropriate training to recognize the signs of such attacks as they are often used as distractions to mask other security breaches.

  

## Man in the Middle (MitM) Attacks

  

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks occur when an attacker intercepts or decrypts communications between two parties. To execute these attacks, the attacker typically gains control over network traffic and misrepresents themselves as a trusted agent or service.  

  

To safeguard against MitM attacks, we should be using secure communication protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) and virtual private network for connections, meticulously validating security certificates, and relying on known secure DNS servers. Additionally, we should be extra cautious when connecting to public WiFi networks and only be using trusted networks, as public WiFi is often a prime target for MitM attacks.

Source: https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/man-in-the-middle-mitm-attack/

  
  

  

  

  

## ARP Spoofing/Poisoning Attacks 

  

ARP Spoofing (Address Resolution Protocol Spoofing) or ARP Poisoning, is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack executed on a network. ARP is a protocol responsible for converting an IP address into its corresponding hardware address (MAC address). In an ARP Spoofing attack, the attacker manipulates the ARP table by injecting misleading ARP responses, redirecting the flow of traffic as dictated by the attacker.

  

This type of attack allows an attacker to monitor, decrypt, or even exchange data packets between devices on a network. In this way, the attacker can steal private data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious actions.

  

There are several methods to prevent or mitigate ARP Spoofing attacks. These include utilizing static ARP tables, implementing security tools to detect ARP Spoofing, and employing network segmentation. Furthermore, adopting secure communication protocols like SSL and HTTPS can make it challenging for attackers to intercept or manipulate traffic.

  

However, we should know that these measures may not always offer complete protection. To ensure comprehensive security, an overarching network security strategy, regular network monitoring, and constant monitoring of potential security threats are also critical.

## IP Spoofing Attacks

  

IP Spoofing is a network attack where an attacker deceives the network or systems by using a counterfeit IP address. This type of attack is often utilized to evade the network's security measures, execute denial-of-service attacks, or engage in identity theft by impersonating another user.

  

The decryption of traffic entering your network, and specifically egress filtering (controlling traffic leaving your network), are some the major techniques to prevent IP spoofing. Egress filtering verifies that the source IP addresses of all packets leaving your network match the IP address of your network. This prevents your network from being part of a DDoS attack.

  

  

## DHCP Starvation Attacks

  

A DHCP Starvation attack is a network attack that targets the resources of a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server on a network, aiming to disrupt the network's stability. The primary objective is to deplete the available IP addresses on the network, thereby preventing other users from acquiring valid IP addresses.

  

A DHCP server automatically allocates IP addresses to systems on a network. In a DHCP starvation attack, the attacker sends multiple spoofed DHCP requests, causing the server to "reserve" IP addresses temporarily, making them unavailable for legitimate users. If enough spoofed requests flood the server, all available IP addresses may become "reserved," preventing real users from obtaining new IP addresses.

  

This attack usually leads to a network being taken out of service (DoS - Denial of Service) because new users cannot connect to the network or existing users' IP addresses cannot be renewed. In some cases, attackers can use this type of attack when trying to add a malicious DHCP server to a network. This provides them with the ability to control the traffic of systems on the network and steal potentially sensitive data.

  

There are ways to protect your network against DHCP Starvation attacks, and you can do that easily by enabling MAC address Decryption, DHCP snooping, and port security.

  

  

## DHCP Spoofing Attacks

  

A DHCP spoofing attack targets the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) protocol, which dynamically assigns the IP addresses of systems on a network. This type of attack usually allows an attacker to take control of the network and monitor traffic on the network.

  

To understand how a DHCP spoofing attack works, it is important to understand how the DHCP protocol works first. When a system connects to a network, the DHCP protocol applies, and a DHCP server on the network assigns an IP address to the system. This process is usually automatic and does not require user intervention.

  

In a DHCP spoofing attack, the attacker typically pretends to be a DHCP server and assigns fake IP addresses to systems connecting to the network. This allows the attacker to control and monitor network traffic. For example, an attacker can monitor the entire Internet traffic of a user by routing it through a proxy server.

  

Several methods can be employed to prevent such attacks. For instance, enabling the DHCP snooping feature on a switch allows it to accept DHCP responses solely from trusted ports, preventing attackers from posing as fake DHCP servers and assigning fake IP addresses to connected systems. Additionally, safeguarding against such attacks involves compelling systems on the network to utilize reliable DNS servers and encrypting traffic.

  

  

## Phishing

  

Phishing is a type of online fraud in which an attacker impersonates a person or organization, usually through an email, text message, or social media message. The attacker's goal is usually to steal the target's personal information, financial information, or login information.

  

Phishing attacks usually occur in the following ways:

  

**Email Phishing:** The attacker sends deceptive emails that mimic reputable entities such as banks, social networks, e-commerce sites, or other trusted organizations. These emails often demand urgent actions and prompt the user to visit a website and provide their personal information. However, the website is typically a counterfeit one, and any data entered by the user is directly transmitted to the attacker.

  

**Spear Phishing:** This is a type of phishing attack that is particularly targeting a specific person within the management of an organization. The attacker creates a customized and convincing message using the personal information of the target.

  

**Whaling:** Similarly to the spear phishing, whaling attacks target the high-profile management personnel within the C-level management.

  

There are several effective strategies to prevent phishing attacks. These include educating users about recognizing and responding to suspicious emails correctly, employing automated email scanning tools to identify potential phishing threats, and implementing additional security measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA). Furthermore, it is essential to verify the security of a website at all times (e.g., ensuring the URL starts with "https" and trusting the site) before disclosing personal and financial information.

  

  

## Malware Attacks 

  

Malware is a term that stands for "malicious software" and typically refers to software designed to harm computer systems, gain unauthorized access, or steal personal and sensitive information. Malware can take various forms, tailored to the attacker's objectives, and often operates covertly, evading detection.

  

Malware attacks usually occur in the following ways:

  

**Viruses:** It is a piece of malware and usually requires a user to run a file or open a plugin. Viruses usually infect and spread to system files.

  

**Trojans (Trojans):** It is software that looks harmless but contains malicious code. It often misleads users and provides access to the user's system.

  

**Worms (Worms):** They are self-contained malware that can spread from one system to another over networks. They require no user interaction.

  

**Ransomware:** It takes the target's data hostage by locking down a computer system or the user's files, usually demanding a ransom.

  

**Spyware:** It monitors the user's activities by infiltrating a computer system and usually steals personal information or credentials.

  

**Adware:** Adware is typically software that displays or redirects unwanted advertisements. While some adware may be harmless, others can be malicious and cause system slowdowns or even steal personal information.

  

Protection against malware attacks typically involves several measures, such as using up-to-date antivirus software, keeping the operating system and applications current, avoiding downloads from unknown or suspicious sources, and being vigilant against phishing attacks. Additionally, making regular backups and implementing multi-factor authentication offer extra layers of protection against such attacks.

  

  

## Brute Force Attacks

  

Brute Force attacks are a form of cyberattack where an attacker attempts all possible combinations to guess a target's password. This is often achieved through automated software tools. The attacker makes multiple attempts on the system to determine if a specific password is correct.

  

Brute Force attacks usually occur in two ways:

  

**Full Brute Force Attacks:** In such attacks, the attacker tries all possible combinations of characters. This usually takes a considerable amount of time and requires sophisticated computer hardware. However, short and weak passwords can be decrypted relatively quickly.

  

**Dictionary-Based Brute Force Attacks:** In such attacks, the attacker usually uses a dictionary file (a list of commonly used or guessed passwords). This is usually faster than full brute force attacks because fewer attempts are made.

  

There are several ways to protect against Brute Force attacks. These include using complex and long passwords, using multi-factor authentication, setting account lockout policies (automatically locking the account after a certain number of failed login attempts), and using security systems that monitor and block multiple login attempts from IP addresses or user accounts.

  

  

## Zero-Day Attacks

  

Zero-Day attacks are cyber attacks that exploit unknown and unpatched vulnerabilities in software (zero-day vulnerabilities). These vulnerabilities are particularly risky since they have not yet been identified or fixed by the software's manufacturer. When attackers discover these weaknesses, they capitalize on the opportunity to harm their targets, steal data, or gain unauthorized access to systems by launching a zero-day attack.

  

Zero-day attacks come to an end when security researchers or manufacturers identify the vulnerability and release a patch. However, during the period before the patch is available, attackers can cause significant harm. These attacks are particularly utilized against critical infrastructures or high-value targets.

  

Protecting against Zero-Day attacks is challenging since they exploit vulnerabilities that are unknown and unpatched. Nonetheless, there are some general strategies:

  

**Keeping the Software Up to Date:** Software manufacturers regularly release updates to fix security vulnerabilities. Implementing these updates quickly can reduce the impact of a zero-day attack.

  

**Using Security Tools:** Some security tools can provide a certain level of protection against zero-day attacks. For example, advanced threat protection (ATP) solutions can use behavioral analysis to identify and block an attack.

  

**Safety Training:** Educating users, especially about the techniques that attackers commonly employ to execute zero-day attacks, such as phishing and social engineering tactics, is of utmost importance.

  

**Network Segmentation and the Principle of Least Privilege:** Restricting cross-system access and providing users with only the necessary privileges can effectively curtail an attacker's access to the system and reduce potential damage.

  

**Regular Backup:** Regular backup of systems and data can help prevent data loss in the event of an attack.
