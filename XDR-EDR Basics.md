### XDR/EDR Introduction

In today's rapidly digitalizing world, cybersecurity threats have been increasingly sophisticated and pose a major risk to organizations. At this point, the concepts of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) has come to the scene. While EDR is an important tool for detecting and responding to cyber threats at endpoints, XDR offers these capabilities in a broader perspective by combining data from the network, cloud and other security sources. In this course, we will examine the role of EDR and XDR in cyber security strategies and provide information on how organizations can strengthen their security solutions in today's complex threat landscape.

  

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

EDR is a security technology used to monitor, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats that occur at the endpoints of computer networks like computers, servers, mobile devices, etc. EDR solutions monitor activities on computers and devices, detect abnormal behaviors and provide rapid response to possible threats. This helps organizations stay secure by increasing the capacity to detect, analyze and respond to cyber-attacks.

EDR solutions typically include the following capabilities:

  

**File and Process Monitoring**

They constantly monitor files and processes on endpoints. In this way, abnormal behavior or signs of malware can be detected.

  

**Behavior Analysis**

EDR solutions detect anomalies by identifying normal usage habits. For example, if an application performs operations, it should not normally do, this can be captured by behavioral analysis.

  

**Malware Detection**

Detects and isolates malware. This helps detect threats such as viruses, trojans, ransomware, etc. at an early stage.

  

**Indicator of Compromise (IOC) Detection**

Uses industry data and threat intelligence to identify known malicious activity. This is important for detecting and responding to previously seen threats.

  

**Event Log Analysis**

Monitors event logs of endpoint devices and identifies abnormal events or security-related situations. This is used to better understand potential threats.

  

**Threat Intelligence Integration**

They can work integrated with external threat intelligence sources. This provides organizations with more effective protection by providing up-to-date threat information.

  

**Post-Monitoring Action Capabilities**

EDR solutions provide the tools and capabilities needed to respond quickly when threats are detected. This is important to minimize the impact of threats and prevent their spread.

  

**Network Monitoring**

EDR can also offer network traffic and communications monitoring capabilities. In this way, they can detect network-based threats.

  

**Data Protection and Encryption**

Some EDR solutions can secure data with encryption and protection features.

  

EDR solutions are an important part of organizations' cyber security strategies to gain a more effective defense and rapid response capability against cyber-attacks.

  

## eXtended Detection and Response (XDR)

XDR is a concept that goes beyond EDR. XDR integrates various security data across the network (such as endpoint, network, cloud) and brings this data together to provide a more comprehensive threat view. XDR helps analyze and detect cyber threats from a broader perspective by analyzing data from different security sources.

XDR solutions typically include the following capabilities:

  

**Multiple Data Source Integration**

XDR brings data together from different sources such as endpoint devices, network traffic, cloud services, and security logs. This gives organizations a broader perspective.

  

**Threat Correlation and Analysis**

Analyzes data from different data sources to show how different threats are correlated and spread. This is often helpful for understanding the entire lifecycle of a threat.

  

**Automatic Threat Detection**

XDR solutions detect abnormal behavior and automatically identify potential threats using technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

  

**Threat Chain Analysis**

XDR analyzes events and relationships to examine how a threat progresses and its effects within the organization. This is important for understanding more complex threats.

  

**Automatic Response Capabilities**

XDR has the ability to implement automatic responses when it detects threats. This helps respond to threats quickly without the need for human intervention.

  

**Threat Intelligence Integration**

XDR integrates up-to-date threat information from threat intelligence sources and better prepares organizations for potential threats.

  

**Incident Management and Analysis**

XDR monitors, analyzes and evaluates different security events in a broad perspective.

  

**Comprehensive Reporting**

XDR solutions provide detailed reports and analysis to understand security incidents and threat status.

  

XDR is an advanced approach that aims to address threats in a more holistic manner by integrating different security sources. In this way, organizations can effectively deal with a broader threat landscape.

  

## Conclusion /Summary

In summary, EDR and XDR are technological approaches to increase organizations' abilities to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. While EDR focuses on monitoring threats occurring at endpoints, XDR offers a more comprehensive approach, combining data from different security sources. Both are important tools for strengthening cybersecurity operations and countering cyber-attacks more effectively.

  

In this part of the training, we have defined what EDR and XDR are and learned about their capabilities. We will be learning about the “ **Commonly Used EDR/XDR Products** ” in the next part of our training.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-3.png)

  
  

**Incidents**

The “Incidents” tab provides a comprehensive summary and analysis of security incidents. This section identifies, classifies and groups potential security threats, breach attempts and other suspicious activities automatically. Using the incidents tab, users can access critical information such as the source of an incident, the devices it affects, the attack vectors used, and the overall severity of the incident. It also includes recommended response actions and automatic response options for each incident. The "Incidents" menu provides security teams with the ability to respond to incidents quickly and effectively, strengthening the organization's security posture against threats.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-4.png)

  
  

**Applications**

Through the “Applications” tab, administrators can see detailed information about the software applications running in their network. This section is critical for tracking the general health, security status, version information of the applications, and if they are vulnerable to any threats. The information provided in the “Applications” tab is critical to identify and manage potential security risks.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-5.png)

  
  

**Activity**

The "Activity" menu is where all activities occurring on the system (threat responses, updates, user actions, etc.) are recorded and accessed. It also tracks a wide range of activities, from log and file transactions to system changes, from network traffic to application behavior. Users can research and access details of events that occurred during a specific time period or on a specific device. This offers a proactive approach to detect possible security breaches or suspicious behavior. The "Activity" menu provides security teams with in-depth visibility, increasing the capacity to identify and analyze potential threats at an early stage.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-8.png)

  
  

## SentinelOne First Configuration

After accessing the SentinelOne account you should follow the below steps to configure your tool effectively:

  

### Identify Sites or Groups:

SentinelOne is a solution that supports multi-tenant structure. You can create multiple Sites and multiple groups under these Sites within your SentinelOne account. One of the first steps to be taken is to determine the sites and groups that properly describe your network. Sites or Groups may have different policies, different inclusions or exclusions, different access permissions, different notification methods, reporting, and etc.

The order is “Account > Site > Groups”.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-9.png)

  
  

For example, if you have an international organization, it may have branches in different countries, and each country location may have its own branches, accounting, sales, and IT teams, etc. There may be different sections. Below is a simple table representing such a structure:

  

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/edr-table-1.png)

  
  

### Set Policies:

In order to avoid unexpected issues before installing the SentinelOne agent, it would be helpful to determine the correct policies beforehand. We can make SentinelOne policies separately for the Account, Site or Groups. Changes that will be made in the upper hierarchical groups (accounts or sites) will also be active in the sites or groups below. You can optionally customize the policies of the sites or groups. You can access the policy window via “SentinelOne > Account/Site/Group > Sentinels > Policy”.

Policy Settings are configured under the titles we mention in detail below.

  

### Protection Mode

SentinelOne basically divides threat types into two: “Malicious Threat” and “Suspicious Threat”. “Detect” or “Protect” actions can be applied for these threat types. Additionally, SentinelOne has various “Detection Engines” to call an event Malicious Threat or Suspicious Threat. Now let's go into some details about these concepts.

  

**Malicious Threat:** A threat or activity that the SentinelOne algorithm definitively identifies as malicious. Items tagged as malicious may be files, URLs, or processes that exhibit known harmful behavior or characteristics. These threats should generally be automatically quarantined and blocked because they can have potentially harmful consequences when active on an endpoint.

  

**Suspicious Threat:** An activity or element of the SentinelOne algorithm that may be potentially malicious, but cannot be definitively identified as malicious. Suspicious tags are often associated with files or processes that display new or unknown behavior but have not yet been fully identified as malicious. Automated actions for suspicious items are generally more moderate and may require a more in-depth review from a security expert.

  

**Detected Mode:** In this mode, the platform detects threats and monitors them, but does not intervene automatically, which does not prevent it from running or quarantine it. It is often used during the initial phase of a new SentinelOne implementation so that the system administrators can evaluate how the platform is performing and monitor for potential false positives.

  

**Protect Mode:** With this mode, it automatically blocks and/or quarantines malware and behavior. When threats are detected, action is taken automatically.

  

**Kill & Quarantine:** Kill is the action of terminating an actively running malicious process. It is used to stop the activity of malware instantly. It isolates a malicious or suspicious file. When this happens, this file will not be able to interact with other system components, its potentially malicious effects gets blocked.

  

**Remediate:** This function repairs the damage caused by the threat. For example, if a malware changes system settings, adds users to the system, etc. This function allows reverting to the original settings.

  

**Rollback:** This function rolls back the changes caused by a threat, allowing the device to return to its pre-threat state. It is especially effective against ransomware attacks. If a ransomware encrypts files, it may be possible to roll back these files to their state before they were encrypted, thanks to the "Rollback" function. It is a feature that can only be used on Windows operating systems. To achieve this, it uses Windows' shadowcopy service.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-10.png)

  
  

### Agent

There are a number of policies that ensure the security of the SentinelOne agent on the endpoints where it is installed. Here are some of them:

  

**Anti Tamper:** The ability to prevent the SentinelOne agent from being modified, disabled or removed by unauthorized users. This feature is designed to prevent malware or attackers from disabling protection mechanisms. It is generally protected by an authorization mechanism controlled through the “uninstaller.exe” provided by the manufacturer or the central management console.

  

**Snapshots:** “Snapshots” are taken by SentinelOne to keep track of changes to a system. It is used to get a detailed view of what happened when a threat is detected or a system event occurs. These snapshots are critical, especially for the ability to rollback changes caused by a threat. It is a feature that can only be used on Windows operating systems. To achieve this, it uses Windows' shadowcopy service.

  

**Logging:** SentinelOne can create detailed logs about system events, threat detections and agent activities. These logs are extremely valuable for security analysis, incident response, and auditing needs. Administrators can configure what information is logged and how long these logs are retained.

  

**Scan New Agents:** This feature determines when and how to first scan a device where a new SentinelOne agent has been installed. This feature is important for running a full system scan at startup to identify any potential threats present and create a clean starting point.

  

You can also set the activities you want to display on the endpoint (notifications, etc.) via the policy screen.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-11.png)

  
  

### Deep Visibility

SentinelOne's Deep Visibility feature allows detailed monitoring of activities occurring in systems to support threat hunting and incident response processes. This feature can save a very large set of data, but exactly which data types it saves may vary depending on the configuration and the version used.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/edr-table-2.png)

  
  
  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-12.png)

  
  

This table is a representative summary of SentinelOne's Deep Visibility feature and may not apply to a particular SentinelOne version or configuration. It is recommended that you consult SentinelOne's official documentation and resources for the most up-to-date and detailed information.

  

### More Options

SentinelOne's "Decommissioning" capability allows an agent to be permanently removed from the SentinelOne platform. Decommissioning is often required when a device is retired or removed from the organization. If you wish, SentinelOne can perform this process automatically for endpoints that are offline on a certain day.

Finally, when you activate the “Remote Shell” option from the policy, you can access the relevant endpoints remotely from the command line with administrator rights. This is access to Powershell on Windows and bash shell on *Nix systems.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/3/image3-13.png)

  
  

## Identify Exclusions

Although this screen is not under the Policy menu in the current version, it has been added under this topic because it affects the functioning of the system.

Necessary exclusions must be defined before the agent installation through the **SentinelOne > Account/Site/Group > Sentinels > Exclusions** menu.

You can apply exclusions on this screen manually or from the catalog (the screen where you can directly select ready-made 3rd party applications).

You can create a new exclusion by selecting “New Exclusion” > “Create Exclusion” on the relevant screen. Here you can define exclusions based on the Hash, the Path, the Certificate, the File Type and the Browser.

### Managing Endpoints with EDR/XDR

EDR and XDR technologies play a critical role in our battle against modern threats in cybersecurity. The effectiveness of these solutions relies heavily on solid endpoint management. Here are some important criteria regarding the importance of endpoint management for EDR/XDR:

  

**Deployment**

Particularly for large-scale organizations, one must decide how to deploy EDR/XDR agents across multiple devices. This can be accomplished through manual installation, group policy, or remote deployment tools (SSCM, etc.). Your solution's agent must be downloaded and installed on the target device. This agent monitors the behavior of the device and helps detect abnormal or harmful activities.

  

**Visibility**

EDR/XDR solutions provide full visibility over all endpoints in the network. This refers to the capacity to understand the state of each device, the security policies implemented, and the processes running on the device. Endpoint management ensures this visibility is continuous and consistent.

  

**Threat Detection**

Modern threats are constantly evolving and becoming more complex. Endpoint management allows potential threats to be quickly identified. Each device can be a threat vector on the network; therefore, knowing and managing each is critical.

  

**Response and Response**

EDR/XDR solutions can detect threats as well as respond to them in real time. However, this is possible with effective endpoint management. For example, it may be necessary to isolate the affected device to prevent the spread of malware.

  

**Policy and Updates**

Endpoint management ensures that established security policies are correctly deployed to all devices. It also allows security software and operating systems to be kept constantly updated.

  

## SentinelOne Endpoint Management

SentinelOne is a cybersecurity solution that incorporates endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. This platform monitors and protects devices through a software component called SentinelOne Agent.

You can view and manage existing endpoints through:

**“SentinelOne > Account/Site/Group > Sentinels > Endpoints”** menu on the SentinelOne Platform.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/4/image4-1.png)

  
  

After selecting an endpoint, you can access many different actions you can take regarding the relevant endpoint by clicking on the "Actions" menu. You can star the ones you use frequently, etc. You can find the most frequently used action menu in the table below:

## SentinelOne Endpoint Agent Install

Installation package and token information is required to install SentinelOne agent on an endpoint.

You can access the SentinelOne agent installation package via the:

**“SentinelOne > Account/Site/Group > Sentinels > Packages”** menu in the interface. On this window, you can apply a filter for the operating system ( i.e. Windows, Linux, MacOS) you are looking for a package. You can also access token information for the relevant site on the same screen.

  
  

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/XDR-EDR+Basics/4/image4-3.png)

  
  

The relevant installation package is downloaded to the endpoint where the installation will be implemented. The installation package is run with admin rights and after the token information is input, click on the "Install" button. After installation, the endpoint must be rebooted so that all engines can actively monitor all processes. After installation, you can see the relevant endpoint in the “Sentinels > Endpoints” section on the SentinelOne interface.

### Data Collection and Log Integration for XDR

While Extended Detection and Response (EDR) systems enable extended threat detection and response, they base much of these capabilities on the information they collect from a wide variety of data sources. In this context, data collection and log integration for XDR is of critical importance. Followings are some of the important points on the data collection and log integration of the extended detection and response tools.

  

## Data Sources

**Network Traffic Information**

Network traffic is a critical data source for detecting abnormal behavior. Information from IDS/IPS systems, network traffic logs, NetFlow data, and other network monitoring tools are included in this category.

  

**Endpoint Data**

EDR systems provide detailed information about operating system events, processes, file activities and other endpoint activities.

  

**Application Logs**

Logs produced by applications are especially important to gain insight into targeted attacks or malware activities.

  

**Cloud Services Logs**

Many organizations are migrating to cloud infrastructure, including cloud-based applications and services. Logs from these services expand XDR's threat detection capability.

  

**Email Logs**

Email logs can help detect phishing attacks, malicious attachments, or other cyber threats.

  

**Sandboxing & Malware Analysis**

Dynamic analysis of suspicious files or URLs can help us understand the nature and behavior of threats.

  

**Threat Intelligence**

Threat intelligence received from external sources, known malicious IPs, domains, file hashes, etc. It provides information about and increases detection capability.

  

Information from these data sources is analyzed by XDR platforms and aggregated to detect potential threats, abnormal behavior or security breaches. With proper integration and normalization, these data sources can greatly improve organizations' cybersecurity postures.

  

## Log Integration

**Automated Integration**

Most modern XDR solutions offer automatic log integration with popular security products, network devices, and cloud services. These integrations are usually accomplished through APIs. It is the best way to increase the effectiveness of XDR systems. This integration enables the XDR platform to automatically collect and analyze information from data sources. This helps security teams detect threats faster and more accurately, without having to manually collect and analyze logs.

  

**Customized Integration**

For custom applications or custom configured systems, XDR platforms typically support manual integrations via APIs or customized log senders. Manual integration is not as efficient as automatic integration, but may be necessary in special cases. For example, if a security product that your organization is using is not supported by your XDR platform, you may need to manually integrate its logs.

  

## Data Enrichment, Storage and Querying

The data collected is often enriched with additional sources such as threat intelligence databases, geographic IP information, or user credentials. In this way, more in-depth analysis, fewer false positives and the ability to respond faster become possible. Ultimately, the effectiveness of XDR depends on the quality of the data collected and how it is enriched.

XDR solutions provide scalable data storage solutions for storing often large amounts of log and event data. It also allows for quick and efficient querying of this data, which is critical for proactive threat hunting and incident investigation. XDR solutions offer the appropriate infrastructure for its data storage and handling. For example, Crowdstrike Falcon XDR maintains and manages its data on the Humio infrastructure.

  

## Conclusion/ Summary

In summary, XDR systems are designed to detect cyber threats earlier and more accurately. These systems collect information from a wide variety of data sources and analyze it to detect potential threats. Log integration can greatly increase the effectiveness of XDR systems. Therefore, when choosing XDR systems, it is important to ensure that they support all the data sources your organization needs.

  

We have covered data sources, log integration, data enrichment, data storage and data query options in this part of our training.
